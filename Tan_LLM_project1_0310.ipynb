move her If you can bounce high bounce for her too Till she cry Lover goldhatted highbouncing lover I must have you Thomas Parke dInvilliers I In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind ever since Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had He didnt say any more but weve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that In consequence Im inclined to reserve all judgements a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild unknown men Most of the confidences were unsoughtfrequently I have feigned sleep preoccupation or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that as my father snobbishly suggested and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth And after boasting this way of my tolerance I come to the admission that it has a limit Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I dont care what its founded on When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart Only Gatsby the man who gives his name to this book was exempt from my reactionGatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures then there was something gorgeous about him some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperamentit was an extraordinary gift for hope a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again NoGatsby turned out all right at the end it is what preyed on Gatsby what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and shortwinded elations of men  My family have been prominent welltodo people in this Middle Western city for three generations The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that were descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch but the actual founder of my line was my grandfathers brother who came here in fiftyone sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today I never saw this greatuncle but Im supposed to look like himwith special reference to the rather hardboiled painting that hangs in fathers office I graduated from New Haven in  just a quarter of a century after my father and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War I enjoyed the counterraid so thoroughly that I came back restless Instead of being the warm centre of the world the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universeso I decided to go East and learn the bond business Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me and finally said Whyyees with very grave hesitant faces Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came East permanently I thought in the spring of twentytwo The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea He found the house a weatherbeaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone I had a dogat least I had him for a few days until he ran awayand an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man more recently arrived than I stopped me on the road How do you get to West Egg village he asked helplessly I told him And as I walked on I was lonely no longer I was a guide a pathfinder an original settler He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breathgiving air I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides I was rather literary in collegeone year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale Newsand now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists the wellrounded man This isnt just an epigramlife is much more successfully looked at from a single window after all It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New Yorkand where there are among other natural curiosities two unusual formations of land Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound They are not perfect ovalslike the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact endbut their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size I lived at West Egg thewell the less fashionable of the two though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them My house was at the very tip of the egg only fifty yards from the Sound and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standardit was a factual imitation of some Htel de Ville in Normandy with a tower on one side spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden It was Gatsbys mansion Or rather as I didnt know Mr Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name My own house was an eyesore but it was a small eyesore and it had been overlooked so I had a view of the water a partial view of my neighbours lawn and the consoling proximity of millionairesall for eighty dollars a month Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans Daisy was my second cousin once removed and Id known Tom in college And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago Her husband among various physical accomplishments had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Havena national figure in a way one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twentyone that everything afterward savours of anticlimax His family were enormously wealthyeven in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproachbut now hed left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away for instance hed brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that Why they came East I dont know They had spent a year in France for no particular reason and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together This was a permanent move said Daisy over the telephone but I didnt believe itI had no sight into Daisys heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all Their house was even more elaborate than I expected a cheerful redandwhite Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardensfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run The front was broken by a line of French windows glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch He had changed since his New Haven years Now he was a sturdy strawhaired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyhe seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat It was a body capable of enormous leveragea cruel body His speaking voice a gruff husky tenor added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed There was a touch of paternal contempt in it even toward people he likedand there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts Now dont think my opinion on these matters is final he seemed to say just because Im stronger and more of a man than you are We were in the same senior society and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh defiant wistfulness of his own We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch Ive got a nice place here he said his eyes flashing about restlessly Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snubnosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore It belonged to Demaine the oil man He turned me around again politely and abruptly Well go inside We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosycoloured space fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house A breeze blew through the room blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags twisting them up toward the frosted weddingcake of the ceiling and then rippled over the winecoloured rug making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor The younger of the two was a stranger to me She was extended full length at her end of the divan completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of itindeed I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in The other girl Daisy made an attempt to riseshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expressionthen she laughed an absurd charming little laugh and I laughed too and came forward into the room Im pparalysed with happiness She laughed again as if she said something very witty and held my hand for a moment looking up into my face promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see That was a way she had She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker Ive heard it said that Daisys murmur was only to make people lean toward her an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming At any rate Miss Bakers lips fluttered she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back againthe object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright Again a sort of apology arose to my lips Almost any exhibition of complete selfsufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low thrilling voice It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget a singing compulsion a whispered Listen a promise that she had done gay exciting things just a while since and that there were gay exciting things hovering in the next hour I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East and how a dozen people had sent their love through me Do they miss me she cried ecstatically The whole town is desolate All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and theres a persistent wail all night along the north shore How gorgeous Lets go back Tom Tomorrow Then she added irrelevantly You ought to see the baby Id like to Shes asleep Shes three years old Havent you ever seen her Never Well you ought to see her Shes Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder What you doing Nick Im a bond man Who with I told him Never heard of them he remarked decisively This annoyed me You will I answered shortly You will if you stay in the East Oh Ill stay in the East dont you worry he said glancing at Daisy and then back at me as if he were alert for something more Id be a God damned fool to live anywhere else At this point Miss Baker said Absolutely with such suddenness that I startedit was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me for she yawned and with a series of rapid deft movements stood up into the room Im stiff she complained Ive been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember Dont look at me Daisy retorted Ive been trying to get you to New York all afternoon No thanks said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry Im absolutely in training Her host looked at her incredulously You are He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass How you ever get anything done is beyond me I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she got done I enjoyed looking at her She was a slender smallbreasted girl with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet Her grey sunstrained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan charming discontented face It occurred to me now that I had seen her or a picture of her somewhere before You live in West Egg she remarked contemptuously I know somebody there I dont know a single You must know Gatsby Gatsby demanded Daisy What Gatsby Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square Slenderly languidly their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out on to a rosycoloured porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind Why candles objected Daisy frowning She snapped them out with her fingers In two weeks itll be the longest day in the year She looked at us all radiantly Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it We ought to plan something yawned Miss Baker sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed All right said Daisy Whatll we plan She turned to me helplessly What do people plan Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger Look she complained I hurt it We all lookedthe knuckle was black and blue You did it Tom she said accusingly I know you didnt mean to but you did do it Thats what I get for marrying a brute of a man a great big hulking physical specimen of a I hate that word hulking  objected Tom crossly even in kidding Hulking insisted Daisy Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire They were here and they accepted Tom and me making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself You make me feel uncivilized Daisy I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret Cant you talk about crops or something I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way Civilizations going to pieces broke out Tom violently Ive gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard Why no I answered rather surprised by his tone Well its a fine book and everybody ought to read it The idea is if we dont look out the white race will bewill be utterly submerged Its all scientific stuff its been proved Toms getting very profound said Daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness He reads deep books with long words in them What was that word we Well these books are all scientific insisted Tom glancing at her impatiently This fellow has worked out the whole thing Its up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things Weve got to beat them down whispered Daisy winking ferociously toward the fervent sun You ought to live in California began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair This idea is that were Nordics I am and you are and you are and After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again And weve produced all the things that go to make civilizationoh science and art and all that Do you see There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency more acute than of old was not enough to him any more When almost immediately the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me Ill tell you a family secret she whispered enthusiastically Its about the butlers nose Do you want to hear about the butlers nose Thats why I came over tonight Well he wasnt always a butler he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose Things went from bad to worse suggested Miss Baker Yes Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listenedthen the glow faded each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk The butler came back and murmured something close to Toms ear whereupon Tom frowned pushed back his chair and without a word went inside As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again her voice glowing and singing I love to see you at my table Nick You remind me of aof a rose an absolute rose Doesnt he She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation An absolute rose This was untrue I am not even faintly like a rose She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless thrilling words Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said Sh in a warning voice A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed trying to hear The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence sank down mounted excitedly and then ceased altogether This Mr Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour I began Dont talk I want to hear what happens Is something happening I inquired innocently You mean to say you dont know said Miss Baker honestly surprised I thought everybody knew I dont Why she said hesitantly Toms got some woman in New York Got some woman I repeated blankly Miss Baker nodded She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time Dont you think Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table It couldnt be helped cried Daisy with tense gaiety She sat down glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued I looked outdoors for a minute and its very romantic outdoors Theres a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line Hes singing away Her voice sang Its romantic isnt it Tom Very romantic he said and then miserably to me If its light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables The telephone rang inside startlingly and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables in fact all subjects vanished into air Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again pointlessly and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone and yet to avoid all eyes I couldnt guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill metallic urgency out of mind To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguingmy own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police The horses needless to say were not mentioned again Tom and Miss Baker with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl We dont know each other very well Nick she said suddenly Even if we are cousins You didnt come to my wedding I wasnt back from the war Thats true She hesitated Well Ive had a very bad time Nick and Im pretty cynical about everything Evidently she had reason to be I waited but she didnt say any more and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter I suppose she talks andeats and everything Oh yes She looked at me absently Listen Nick let me tell you what I said when she was born Would you like to hear Very much Itll show you how Ive gotten to feel aboutthings Well she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl She told me it was a girl and so I turned my head away and wept All right I said Im glad its a girl And I hope shell be a foolthats the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful little fool You see I think everythings terrible anyhow she went on in a convinced way Everybody thinks sothe most advanced people And I know Ive been everywhere and seen everything and done everything Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way rather like Toms and she laughed with thrilling scorn SophisticatedGod Im sophisticated The instant her voice broke off ceasing to compel my attention my belief I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said It made me uneasy as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me I waited and sure enough in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged  Inside the crimson room bloomed with light Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Postthe words murmurous and uninflected running together in a soothing tune The lamplight bright on his boots and dull on the autumnleaf yellow of her hair glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand To be continued she said tossing the magazine on the table in our very next issue Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee and she stood up Ten oclock she remarked apparently finding the time on the ceiling Time for this good girl to go to bed Jordans going to play in the tournament tomorrow explained Daisy over at Westchester Ohyoure Jordan Baker I knew now why her face was familiarits pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach I had heard some story of her too a critical unpleasant story but what it was I had forgotten long ago Good night she said softly Wake me at eight wont you If youll get up I will Good night Mr Carraway See you anon Of course you will confirmed Daisy In fact I think Ill arrange a marriage Come over often Nick and Ill sort ofohfling you together You knowlock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat and all that sort of thing Good night called Miss Baker from the stairs I havent heard a word Shes a nice girl said Tom after a moment They oughtnt to let her run around the country this way Who oughtnt to inquired Daisy coldly Her family Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old Besides Nicks going to look after her arent you Nick Shes going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer I think the home influence will be very good for her Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence Is she from New York I asked quickly From Louisville Our white girlhood was passed together there Our beautiful white Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda demanded Tom suddenly Did I She looked at me I cant seem to remember but I think we talked about the Nordic race Yes Im sure we did It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know Dont believe everything you hear Nick he advised me I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all and a few minutes later I got up to go home They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called Wait I forgot to ask you something and its important We heard you were engaged to a girl out West Thats right corroborated Tom kindly We heard that you were engaged Its a libel Im too poor But we heard it insisted Daisy surprising me by opening up again in a flowerlike way We heard it from three people so it must be true Of course I knew what they were referring to but I wasnt even vaguely engaged The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East You cant stop going with an old friend on account of rumours and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely richnevertheless I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house child in armsbut apparently there were no such intentions in her head As for Tom the fact that he had some woman in New York was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages where new red petrolpumps sat out in pools of light and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard The wind had blown off leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alonefifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbours mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr Gatsby himself come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens I decided to call to him Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner and that would do for an introduction But I didnt call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alonehe stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling Involuntarily I glanced seawardand distinguished nothing except a single green light minute and far away that might have been the end of a dock When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness II About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land This is a valley of ashesa fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally with a transcendent effort of ashgrey men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest and immediately the ashgrey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it you perceive after a moment the eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg The eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg are blue and gigantictheir retinas are one yard high They look out of no face but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away But his eyes dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain brood on over the solemn dumping ground The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanans mistress The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafs with her and leaving her at a table sauntered about chatting with whomsoever he knew Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet herbut I did I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car Were getting off he insisted I want you to meet my girl I think hed tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburgs persistent stare The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an allnight restaurant approached by a trail of ashes the third was a garageRepairs George B Wilson Cars bought and soldand I followed Tom inside The interior was unprosperous and bare the only car visible was the dustcovered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office wiping his hands on a piece of waste He was a blond spiritless man anaemic and faintly handsome When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes Hello Wilson old man said Tom slapping him jovially on the shoulder Hows business I cant complain answered Wilson unconvincingly When are you going to sell me that car Next week Ive got my man working on it now Works pretty slow dont he No he doesnt said Tom coldly And if you feel that way about it maybe Id better sell it somewhere else after all I dont mean that explained Wilson quickly I just meant His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door She was in the middle thirties and faintly stout but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can Her face above a spotted dress of dark blue crpedechine contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom looking him flush in the eye Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft coarse voice Get some chairs why dont you so somebody can sit down Oh sure agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinityexcept his wife who moved close to Tom I want to see you said Tom intently Get on the next train All right Ill meet you by the newsstand on the lower level She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door We waited for her down the road and out of sight It was a few days before the Fourth of July and a grey scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track Terrible place isnt it said Tom exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg Awful It does her good to get away Doesnt her husband object Wilson He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York Hes so dumb he doesnt know hes alive So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New Yorkor not quite together for Mrs Wilson sat discreetly in another car Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a movingpicture magazine and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume Upstairs in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one lavendercoloured with grey upholstery and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass I want to get one of those dogs she said earnestly I want to get one for the apartment Theyre nice to havea dog We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D Rockefeller In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed What kind are they asked Mrs Wilson eagerly as he came to the taxiwindow All kinds What kind do you want lady Id like to get one of those police dogs I dont suppose you got that kind The man peered doubtfully into the basket plunged in his hand and drew one up wriggling by the back of the neck Thats no police dog said Tom No its not exactly a police dog said the man with disappointment in his voice Its more of an Airedale He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back Look at that coat Some coat Thats a dog thatll never bother you with catching cold I think its cute said Mrs Wilson enthusiastically How much is it That dog He looked at it admiringly That dog will cost you ten dollars The Airedaleundoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly whitechanged hands and settled down into Mrs Wilsons lap where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture Is it a boy or a girl she asked delicately That dog That dogs a boy Its a bitch said Tom decisively Heres your money Go and buy ten more dogs with it We drove over to Fifth Avenue warm and soft almost pastoral on the summer Sunday afternoon I wouldnt have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner Hold on I said I have to leave you here No you dont interposed Tom quickly Myrtlell be hurt if you dont come up to the apartment Wont you Myrtle Come on she urged Ill telephone my sister Catherine Shes said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know Well Id like to but We went on cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds At th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartmenthouses Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood Mrs Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in Im going to have the McKees come up she announced as we rose in the elevator And of course I got to call up my sister too The apartment was on the top floora small livingroom a small diningroom a small bedroom and a bath The livingroom was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles The only picture was an overenlarged photograph apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway Mrs Wilson was first concerned with the dog A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuitsone of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight oclock the apartment was full of cheerful sun Sitting on Toms lap Mrs Wilson called up several people on the telephone then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner When I came back they had both disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the livingroom and read a chapter of Simon Called Petereither it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things because it didnt make any sense to me Just as Tom and Myrtle after the first drink Mrs Wilson and I called each other by our first names reappeared company commenced to arrive at the apartment door The sister Catherine was a slender worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here But when I asked her she laughed immoderately repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel Mr McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room He informed me that he was in the artistic game and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs Wilsons mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall His wife was shrill languid handsome and horrible She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twentyseven times since they had been married Mrs Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of creamcoloured chiffon which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur Her laughter her gestures her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy creaking pivot through the smoky air My dear she told her sister in a high mincing shout most of these fellas will cheat you every time All they think of is money I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill youd of thought she had my appendicitis out What was the name of the woman asked Mrs McKee Mrs Eberhardt She goes around looking at peoples feet in their own homes I like your dress remarked Mrs McKee I think its adorable Mrs Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain Its just a crazy old thing she said I just slip it on sometimes when I dont care what I look like But it looks wonderful on you if you know what I mean pursued Mrs McKee If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it We all looked in silence at Mrs Wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile Mr McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face I should change the light he said after a moment Id like to bring out the modelling of the features And Id try to get hold of all the back hair I wouldnt think of changing the light cried Mrs McKee I think its Her husband said Sh and we all looked at the subject again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet You McKees have something to drink he said Get some more ice and mineral water Myrtle before everybody goes to sleep I told that boy about the ice Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders These people You have to keep after them all the time She looked at me and laughed pointlessly Then she flounced over to the dog kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there Ive done some nice things out on Long Island asserted Mr McKee Tom looked at him blankly Two of them we have framed downstairs Two what demanded Tom Two studies One of them I call Montauk PointThe Gulls and the other I call Montauk PointThe Sea The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch Do you live down on Long Island too she inquired I live at West Egg Really I was down there at a party about a month ago At a man named Gatsbys Do you know him I live next door to him Well they say hes a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelms Thats where all his money comes from Really She nodded Im scared of him Id hate to have him get anything on me This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs McKees pointing suddenly at Catherine Chester I think you could do something with her she broke out but Mr McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to Tom Id like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry All I ask is that they should give me a start Ask Myrtle said Tom breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs Wilson entered with a tray Shell give you a letter of introduction wont you Myrtle Do what she asked startled Youll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband so he can do some studies of him His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented  George B Wilson at the Gasoline Pump or something like that Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear Neither of them can stand the person theyre married to Cant they Cant stand them She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom What I say is why go on living with them if they cant stand them If I was them Id get a divorce and get married to each other right away Doesnt she like Wilson either The answer to this was unexpected It came from Myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene You see cried Catherine triumphantly She lowered her voice again Its really his wife thats keeping them apart Shes a Catholic and they dont believe in divorce Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie When they do get married continued Catherine theyre going West to live for a while until it blows over Itd be more discreet to go to Europe Oh do you like Europe she exclaimed surprisingly I just got back from Monte Carlo Really Just last year I went over there with another girl Stay long No we just went to Monte Carlo and back We went by way of Marseilles We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms We had an awful time getting back I can tell you God how I hated that town The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterraneanthen the shrill voice of Mrs McKee called me back into the room I almost made a mistake too she declared vigorously I almost married a little kike whod been after me for years I knew he was below me Everybody kept saying to me Lucille that mans way below you But if I hadnt met Chester hed of got me sure Yes but listen said Myrtle Wilson nodding her head up and down at least you didnt marry him I know I didnt Well I married him said Myrtle ambiguously And thats the difference between your case and mine Why did you Myrtle demanded Catherine Nobody forced you to Myrtle considered I married him because I thought he was a gentleman she said finally I thought he knew something about breeding but he wasnt fit to lick my shoe You were crazy about him for a while said Catherine Crazy about him cried Myrtle incredulously Who said I was crazy about him I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there She pointed suddenly at me and everyone looked at me accusingly I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection The only crazy I was was when I married him I knew right away I made a mistake He borrowed somebodys best suit to get married in and never even told me about it and the man came after it one day when he was out Oh is that your suit I said This is the first I ever heard about it But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon She really ought to get away from him resumed Catherine to me Theyve been living over that garage for eleven years And Toms the first sweetie she ever had The bottle of whiskya second onewas now in constant demand by all present excepting Catherine who felt just as good on nothing at all Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches which were a complete supper in themselves I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back as if with ropes into my chair Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets and I saw him too looking up and wondering I was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and I couldnt keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head When we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm and so I told him Id have to call a policeman but he knew I lied I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didnt hardly know I wasnt getting into a subway train All I kept thinking about over and over was You cant live forever you cant live forever  She turned to Mrs McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter My dear she cried Im going to give you this dress as soon as Im through with it Ive got to get another one tomorrow Im going to make a list of all the things Ive got to get A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring and a wreath with a black silk bow for mothers grave thatll last all summer I got to write down a list so I wont forget all the things I got to do It was nine oclockalmost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten Mr McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap like a photograph of a man of action Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly People disappeared reappeared made plans to go somewhere and then lost each other searched for each other found each other a few feet away Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs Wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs Wilson had any right to mention Daisys name Daisy Daisy Daisy shouted Mrs Wilson Ill say it whenever I want to Daisy Dai Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor and womens voices scolding and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain Mr McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scenehis wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles Then Mr McKee turned and continued on out the door Taking my hat from the chandelier I followed Come to lunch some day he suggested as we groaned down in the elevator Where Anywhere Keep your hands off the lever snapped the elevator boy I beg your pardon said Mr McKee with dignity I didnt know I was touching it All right I agreed Ill be glad to  I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets clad in his underwear with a great portfolio in his hands Beauty and the Beast  Loneliness  Old Grocery Horse  Brookn Bridge  Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station staring at the morning Tribune and waiting for the four oclock train III There was music from my neighbours house through the summer nights In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the Sound drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam On weekends his RollsRoyce became an omnibus bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbingbrushes and hammers and gardenshears repairing the ravages of the night before Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New Yorkevery Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butlers thumb At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsbys enormous garden On buffet tables garnished with glistening horsdoeuvre spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another By seven oclock the orchestra has arrived no thin fivepiece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours and hair bobbed in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each others names The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher Laughter is easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tipped out at a cheerful word The groups change more swiftly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable become for a sharp joyous moment the centre of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the seachange of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal seizes a cocktail out of the air dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform A momentary hush the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Grays understudy from the Follies The party has begun I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsbys house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited People were not invitedthey went there They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsbys door Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission I had been actually invited A chauffeur in a uniform of robinsegg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer the honour would be entirely Gatsbys it said if I would attend his little party that night He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented itsigned Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didnt knowthough here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about all well dressed all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans I was sure that they were selling something bonds or insurance or automobiles They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail tablethe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden Welcome or not I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby Hello I roared advancing toward her My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden I thought you might be here she responded absently as I came up I remembered you lived next door to She held my hand impersonally as a promise that shed take care of me in a minute and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps Hello they cried together Sorry you didnt win That was for the golf tournament She had lost in the finals the week before You dont know who we are said one of the girls in yellow but we met you here about a month ago Youve dyed your hair since then remarked Jordan and I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon produced like the supper no doubt out of a caterers basket With Jordans slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men each one introduced to us as Mr Mumble Do you come to these parties often inquired Jordan of the girl beside her The last one was the one I met you at answered the girl in an alert confident voice She turned to her companion Wasnt it for you Lucille It was for Lucille too I like to come Lucille said I never care what I do so I always have a good time When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair and he asked me my name and addressinside of a week I got a package from Croiriers with a new evening gown in it Did you keep it asked Jordan Sure I did I was going to wear it tonight but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered It was gas blue with lavender beads Two hundred and sixtyfive dollars Theres something funny about a fellow thatll do a thing like that said the other girl eagerly He doesnt want any trouble with anybody Who doesnt I inquired Gatsby Somebody told me The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once A thrill passed over all of us The three Mr Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly I dont think its so much that argued Lucille sceptically Its more that he was a German spy during the war One of the men nodded in confirmation I heard that from a man who knew all about him grew up with him in Germany he assured us positively Oh no said the first girl it couldnt be that because he was in the American army during the war As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodys looking at him Ill bet he killed a man She narrowed her eyes and shivered Lucille shivered We all turned and looked around for Gatsby It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world The first supperthere would be another one after midnightwas now being served and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden There were three married couples and Jordans escort a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countrysideEast Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety Lets get out whispered Jordan after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate halfhour this is much too polite for me We got up and she explained that we were going to find the host I had never met him she said and it was making me uneasy The undergraduate nodded in a cynical melancholy way The bar where we glanced first was crowded but Gatsby was not there She couldnt find him from the top of the steps and he wasnt on the veranda On a chance we tried an importantlooking door and walked into a high Gothic library panelled with carved English oak and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas A stout middleaged man with enormous owleyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot What do you think he demanded impetuously About what He waved his hand toward the bookshelves About that As a matter of fact you neednt bother to ascertain I ascertained Theyre real The books He nodded Absolutely realhave pages and everything I thought theyd be a nice durable cardboard Matter of fact theyre absolutely real Pages andHere Lemme show you Taking our scepticism for granted he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures See he cried triumphantly Its a bonafide piece of printed matter It fooled me This fellas a regular Belasco Its a triumph What thoroughness What realism Knew when to stop toodidnt cut the pages But what do you want What do you expect He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse Who brought you he demanded Or did you just come I was brought Most people were brought Jordan looked at him alertly cheerfully without answering I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt he continued Mrs Claud Roosevelt Do you know her I met her somewhere last night Ive been drunk for about a week now and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library Has it A little bit I think I cant tell yet Ive only been here an hour Did I tell you about the books Theyre real Theyre You told us We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles superior couples holding each other tortuously fashionably and keeping in the cornersand a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps By midnight the hilarity had increased A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky A pair of stage twins who turned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than fingerbowls The moon had risen higher and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales trembling a little to the stiff tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn I was still with Jordan Baker We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter I was enjoying myself now I had taken two fingerbowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant elemental and profound At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled Your face is familiar he said politely Werent you in the First Division during the war Why yes I was in the Twentyeighth Infantry I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteeneighteen I knew Id seen you somewhere before We talked for a moment about some wet grey little villages in France Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning Want to go with me old sport Just near the shore along the Sound What time Any time that suits you best It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled Having a gay time now she inquired Much better I turned again to my new acquaintance This is an unusual party for me I havent even seen the host I live over there I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand Im Gatsby he said suddenly What I exclaimed Oh I beg your pardon I thought you knew old sport Im afraid Im not a very good host He smiled understandinglymuch more than understandingly It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life It facedor seemed to facethe whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that at your best you hoped to convey Precisely at that point it vanishedand I was looking at an elegant young roughneck a year or two over thirty whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd Some time before he introduced himself Id got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care Almost at the moment when Mr Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn If you want anything just ask for it old sport he urged me Excuse me I will rejoin you later When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordanconstrained to assure her of my surprise I had expected that Mr Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years Who is he I demanded Do you know Hes just a man named Gatsby Where is he from I mean And what does he do Now youre started on the subject she answered with a wan smile Well he told me once he was an Oxford man A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away However I dont believe it Why not I dont know she insisted I just dont think he went there Something in her tone reminded me of the other girls I think he killed a man and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York That was comprehensible But young men didntat least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didntdrift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound Anyhow he gives large parties said Jordan changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete And I like large parties Theyre so intimate At small parties there isnt any privacy There was the boom of a bass drum and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden Ladies and gentlemen he cried At the request of Mr Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr Vladmir Tostoffs latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation He smiled with jovial condescension and added Some sensation Whereupon everybody laughed The piece is known he concluded lustily as Vladmir Tostoffs Jazz History of the World  The nature of Mr Tostoffs composition eluded me because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day I could see nothing sinister about him I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased When the Jazz History of the World was over girls were putting their heads on mens shoulders in a puppyish convivial way girls were swooning backward playfully into mens arms even into groups knowing that someone would arrest their fallsbut no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsbys shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsbys head for one link I beg your pardon Gatsbys butler was suddenly standing beside us Miss Baker he inquired I beg your pardon but Mr Gatsby would like to speak to you alone With me she exclaimed in surprise Yes madame She got up slowly raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment and followed the butler toward the house I noticed that she wore her eveningdress all her dresses like sports clothesthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean crisp mornings I was alone and it was almost two For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long manywindowed room which overhung the terrace Eluding Jordans undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls and who implored me to join him I went inside The large room was full of people One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall redhaired young lady from a famous chorus engaged in song She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sadshe was not only singing she was weeping too Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano The tears coursed down her cheeksnot freely however for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep She had a fight with a man who says hes her husband explained a girl at my elbow I looked around Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands Even Jordans party the quartet from East Egg were rent asunder by dissension One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacksat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond and hissed You promised into his ear The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices Whenever he sees Im having a good time he wants to go home Never heard anything so selfish in my life Were always the first ones to leave So are we Well were almost the last tonight said one of the men sheepishly The orchestra left half an hour ago In spite of the wives agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short struggle and both wives were lifted kicking into the night As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye Jordans party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands Ive just heard the most amazing thing she whispered How long were we in there Why about an hour It was  simply amazing she repeated abstractedly But I swore I wouldnt tell it and here I am tantalizing you She yawned gracefully in my face Please come and see me  Phone book  Under the name of Mrs Sigourney Howard  My aunt  She was hurrying off as she talkedher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late I joined the last of Gatsbys guests who were clustered around him I wanted to explain that Id hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden Dont mention it he enjoined me eagerly Dont give it another thought old sport The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder And dont forget were going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine oclock Then the butler behind his shoulder Philadelphia wants you on the phone sir All right in a minute Tell them Ill be right there  Good night Good night Good night He smiledand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go as if he had desired it all the time Good night old sport  Good night But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene In the ditch beside the road right side up but violently shorn of one wheel rested a new coup which had left Gatsbys drive not two minutes before The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs However as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant puzzled way See he explained It went in the ditch The fact was infinitely astonishing to him and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the manit was the late patron of Gatsbys library Howd it happen He shrugged his shoulders I know nothing whatever about mechanics he said decisively But how did it happen Did you run into the wall Dont ask me said Owl Eyes washing his hands of the whole matter I know very little about drivingnext to nothing It happened and thats all I know Well if youre a poor driver you oughtnt to try driving at night But I wasnt even trying he explained indignantly I wasnt even trying An awed hush fell upon the bystanders Do you want to commit suicide Youre lucky it was just a wheel A bad driver and not even trying You dont understand explained the criminal I wasnt driving Theres another man in the car The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained Ahhh as the door of the coup swung slowly open The crowdit was now a crowdstepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause Then very gradually part by part a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster Whas matter he inquired calmly Did we run outa gas Look Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheelhe stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky It came off someone explained He nodded At first I din notice wed stopped A pause Then taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice Wonderff tell me where theres a gasline station At least a dozen men some of them a little better off than he was explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond Back out he suggested after a moment Put her in reverse But the wheels off He hesitated No harm in trying he said The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home I glanced back once A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsbys house making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell  Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs Most of the time I worked In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust I knew the other clerks and young bondsalesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away I took dinner usually at the Yale Clubfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work After that if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station I began to like New York the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove Sometimes in my mind I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life Again at eight oclock when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district I felt a sinking in my heart Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside Imagining that I too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement I wished them well For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker and then in midsummer I found her again At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name Then it was something more I wasnt actually in love but I felt a sort of tender curiosity The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed somethingmost affectations conceal something eventually even though they dont in the beginningand one day I found what it was When we were on a houseparty together up in Warwick she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down and then lied about itand suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisys At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapersa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round The thing approached the proportions of a scandalthen died away A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken The incident and the name had remained together in my mind Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible She was incurably dishonest She wasnt able to endure being at a disadvantage and given this unwillingness I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body It made no difference to me Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyI was casually sorry and then I forgot It was on that same houseparty that we had a curious conversation about driving a car It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one mans coat Youre a rotten driver I protested Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtnt to drive at all I am careful No youre not Well other people are she said lightly Whats that got to do with it Theyll keep out of my way she insisted It takes two to make an accident Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself I hope I never will she answered I hate careless people Thats why I like you Her grey sunstrained eyes stared straight ahead but she had deliberately shifted our relations and for a moment I thought I loved her But I am slowthinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home Id been writing letters once a week and signing them Love Nick and all I could think of was how when that certain girl played tennis a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues and this is mine I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known IV On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore the world and its mistress returned to Gatsbys house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn Hes a bootlegger said the young ladies moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil Reach me a rose honey and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsbys house that summer It is an old timetable now disintegrating at its folds and headed This schedule in effect July th  But I can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsbys hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him From East Egg then came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in Maine And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near And the Ismays and the Chrysties or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr Chrysties wife and Edgar Beaver whose hair they say turned cottonwhite one winter afternoon for no good reason at all Clarence Endive was from East Egg as I remember He came only once in white knickerbockers and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O R P Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs Ulysses Swetts automobile ran over his right hand The Dancies came too and S B Whitebait who was well over sixty and Maurice A Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Belugas girls From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S Schwartz the son and Arthur McCarty all connected with the movies in one way or another And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G Earl Muldoon brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife Da Fontano the promoter came there and Ed Legros and James B RotGut Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lillythey came to gamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as the boarderI doubt if he had any other home Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace ODonavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S W Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns divorced now and Henry L Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before I have forgotten their namesJaqueline I think or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins if pressed they would confess themselves to be In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina OBrien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr Albrucksburger and Miss Haag his fiance and Ardita FitzPeters and Mr P Jewett once head of the American Legion and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name if I ever knew it I have forgotten All these people came to Gatsbys house in the summer  At nine oclock one morning late in July Gatsbys gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its threenoted horn It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties mounted in his hydroplane and at his urgent invitation made frequent use of his beach Good morning old sport Youre having lunch with me today and I thought wed ride up together He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly Americanthat comes I suppose with the absence of lifting work in youth and even more with the formless grace of our nervous sporadic games This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness He was never quite still there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand He saw me looking with admiration at his car Its pretty isnt it old sport He jumped off to give me a better view Havent you ever seen it before Id seen it Everybody had seen it It was a rich cream colour bright with nickel swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supperboxes and toolboxes and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found to my disappointment that he had little to say So my first impression that he was a person of some undefined consequence had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door And then came that disconcerting ride We hadnt reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramelcoloured suit Look here old sport he broke out surprisingly whats your opinion of me anyhow A little overwhelmed I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves Well Im going to tell you something about my life he interrupted I dont want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls Ill tell you Gods truth His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle Westall dead now I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years It is a family tradition He looked at me sidewaysand I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying He hurried the phrase educated at Oxford or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before And with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasnt something a little sinister about him after all What part of the Middle West I inquired casually San Francisco I see My family all died and I came into a good deal of money His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of EuropeParis Venice Romecollecting jewels chiefly rubies hunting big game painting a little things for myself only and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned character leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne Then came the war old sport It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machinegun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldnt advance We stayed there two days and two nights a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decorationeven Montenegro little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea Little Montenegro He lifted up the words and nodded at themwith his smile The smile comprehended Montenegros troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegros warm little heart My incredulity was submerged in fascination now it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal slung on a ribbon fell into my palm Thats the one from Montenegro To my astonishment the thing had an authentic look Orderi di Danilo ran the circular legend Montenegro Nicolas Rex Turn it Major Jay Gatsby I read For Valour Extraordinary Heres another thing I always carry A souvenir of Oxford days It was taken in Trinity Quadthe man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires There was Gatsby looking a little not much youngerwith a cricket bat in his hand Then it was all true I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease with their crimsonlighted depths the gnawings of his broken heart Im going to make a big request of you today he said pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction so I thought you ought to know something about me I didnt want you to think I was just some nobody You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me He hesitated Youll hear about it this afternoon At lunch No this afternoon I happened to find out that youre taking Miss Baker to tea Do you mean youre in love with Miss Baker No old sport Im not But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter I hadnt the faintest idea what this matter was but I was more annoyed than interested I hadnt asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr Jay Gatsby I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I was sorry Id ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn He wouldnt say another word His correctness grew on him as we neared the city We passed Port Roosevelt where there was a glimpse of redbelted oceangoing ships and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark undeserted saloons of the fadedgilt nineteenhundreds Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us and I had a glimpse of Mrs Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoriaonly half for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar jugjugspat of a motorcycle and a frantic policeman rode alongside All right old sport called Gatsby We slowed down Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the mans eyes Right you are agreed the policeman tipping his cap Know you next time Mr Gatsby Excuse me What was that I inquired The picture of Oxford I was able to do the commissioner a favour once and he sends me a Christmas card every year Over the great bridge with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe and I was glad that the sight of Gatsbys splendid car was included in their sombre holiday As we crossed Blackwells Island a limousine passed us driven by a white chauffeur in which sat three modish negroes two bucks and a girl I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry Anything can happen now that weve slid over this bridge I thought anything at all  Even Gatsby could happen without any particular wonder  Roaring noon In a wellfanned Fortysecond Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom talking to another man Mr Carraway this is my friend Mr Wolfshiem A small flatnosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the halfdarkness So I took one look at him said Mr Wolfshiem shaking my hand earnestly and what do you think I did What I inquired politely But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said All right Katspaugh dont pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth He shut it then and there Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon Mr Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction Highballs asked the head waiter This is a nice restaurant here said Mr Wolfshiem looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling But I like across the street better Yes highballs agreed Gatsby and then to Mr Wolfshiem Its too hot over there Hot and smallyes said Mr Wolfshiem but full of memories What place is that I asked The old Metropole The old Metropole brooded Mr Wolfshiem gloomily Filled with faces dead and gone Filled with friends gone now forever I cant forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside All right says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair  Let the bastards come in here if they want you Rosy but dont you so help me move outside this room It was four oclock in the morning then and if wed of raised the blinds wed of seen daylight Did he go I asked innocently Sure he went Mr Wolfshiems nose flashed at me indignantly He turned around in the door and says Dont let that waiter take away my coffee Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away Four of them were electrocuted I said remembering Five with Becker His nostrils turned to me in an interested way I understand youre looking for a business gonnegtion The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling Gatsby answered for me Oh no he exclaimed this isnt the man No Mr Wolfshiem seemed disappointed This is just a friend I told you wed talk about that some other time I beg your pardon said Mr Wolfshiem I had a wrong man A succulent hash arrived and Mr Wolfshiem forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole began to eat with ferocious delicacy His eyes meanwhile roved very slowly all around the roomhe completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind I think that except for my presence he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table Look here old sport said Gatsby leaning toward me Im afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car There was the smile again but this time I held out against it I dont like mysteries I answered and I dont understand why you wont come out frankly and tell me what you want Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker Oh its nothing underhand he assured me Miss Bakers a great sportswoman you know and shed never do anything that wasnt all right Suddenly he looked at his watch jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with Mr Wolfshiem at the table He has to telephone said Mr Wolfshiem following him with his eyes Fine fellow isnt he Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman Yes Hes an Oggsford man Oh He went to Oggsford College in England You know Oggsford College Ive heard of it Its one of the most famous colleges in the world Have you known Gatsby for a long time I inquired Several years he answered in a gratified way I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour I said to myself Theres the kind of man youd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister  He paused I see youre looking at my cuff buttons I hadnt been looking at them but I did now They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory Finest specimens of human molars he informed me Well I inspected them Thats a very interesting idea Yeah He flipped his sleeves up under his coat Yeah Gatsbys very careful about women He would never so much as look at a friends wife When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet I have enjoyed my lunch he said and Im going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome Dont hurry Meyer said Gatsby without enthusiasm Mr Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction Youre very polite but I belong to another generation he announced solemnly You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand As for me I am fifty years old and I wont impose myself on you any longer As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling I wondered if I had said anything to offend him He becomes very sentimental sometimes explained Gatsby This is one of his sentimental days Hes quite a character around New Yorka denizen of Broadway Who is he anyhow an actor No A dentist Meyer Wolfshiem No hes a gambler Gatsby hesitated then added coolly Hes the man who fixed the Worlds Series back in  Fixed the Worlds Series I repeated The idea staggered me I remembered of course that the Worlds Series had been fixed in  but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened the end of some inevitable chain It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million peoplewith the singlemindedness of a burglar blowing a safe How did he happen to do that I asked after a minute He just saw the opportunity Why isnt he in jail They cant get him old sport Hes a smart man I insisted on paying the check As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room Come along with me for a minute I said Ive got to say hello to someone When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction Whereve you been he demanded eagerly Daisys furious because you havent called up This is Mr Gatsby Mr Buchanan They shook hands briefly and a strained unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsbys face Howve you been anyhow demanded Tom of me Howd you happen to come up this far to eat Ive been having lunch with Mr Gatsby I turned toward Mr Gatsby but he was no longer there  One October day in nineteenseventeen said Jordan Baker that afternoon sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the teagarden at the Plaza Hotel I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tuttuttuttut in a disapproving way The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fays house She was just eighteen two years older than me and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville She dressed in white and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night Anyways for an hour When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before They were so engrossed in each other that she didnt see me until I was five feet away Hello Jordan she called unexpectedly Please come here I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me because of all the older girls I admired her most She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages I was Well then would I tell them that she couldnt come that day The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since His name was Jay Gatsby and I didnt lay eyes on him again for over four yearseven after Id met him on Long Island I didnt realize it was the same man That was nineteenseventeen By the next year I had a few beaux myself and I began to play in tournaments so I didnt see Daisy very often She went with a slightly older crowdwhen she went with anyone at all Wild rumours were circulating about herhow her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas She was effectually prevented but she wasnt on speaking terms with her family for several weeks After that she didnt play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flatfooted shortsighted young men in town who couldnt get into the army at all By the next autumn she was gay again gay as ever She had a dbut after the armistice and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars I was a bridesmaid I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dressand as drunk as a monkey She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other  Gratulate me she muttered Never had a drink before but oh how I do enjoy it Whats the matter Daisy I was scared I can tell you Id never seen a girl like that before Here dearies She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls Take em downstairs and give em back to whoever they belong to Tell em all Daisys change her mine Say Daisys change her mine  She began to cryshe cried and cried I rushed out and found her mothers maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath She wouldnt let go of the letter She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball and only let me leave it in the soapdish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow But she didnt say another word We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over Next day at five oclock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months trip to the South Seas I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought Id never seen a girl so mad about her husband If he left the room for a minute shed look around uneasily and say Wheres Tom gone and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight It was touching to see them togetherit made you laugh in a hushed fascinated way That was in August A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car The girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was brokenshe was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down Daisy was popular in Chicago as you know They moved with a fast crowd all of them young and rich and wild but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation Perhaps because she doesnt drink Its a great advantage not to drink among harddrinking people You can hold your tongue and moreover you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they dont see or care Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at alland yet theres something in that voice of hers  Well about six weeks ago she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years It was when I asked youdo you rememberif you knew Gatsby in West Egg After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up and said What Gatsby and when I described himI was half asleepshe said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know It wasnt until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car  When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of children already gathered like crickets on the grass rose through the hot twilight Im the Sheik of Araby Your love belongs to me At night when youre asleep Into your tent Ill creep It was a strange coincidence I said But it wasnt a coincidence at all Why not Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night He came alive to me delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour He wants to know continued Jordan if youll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over The modesty of the demand shook me He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual mothsso that he could come over some afternoon to a strangers garden Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing Hes afraid hes waited so long He thought you might be offended You see hes regular tough underneath it all Something worried me Why didnt he ask you to arrange a meeting He wants her to see his house she explained And your house is right next door Oh I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties some night went on Jordan but she never did Then he began asking people casually if they knew her and I was the first one he found It was that night he sent for me at his dance and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it Of course I immediately suggested a luncheon in New Yorkand I thought hed go mad  I dont want to do anything out of the way he kept saying I want to see her right next door When I said you were a particular friend of Toms he started to abandon the whole idea He doesnt know very much about Tom though he says hes read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisys name It was dark now and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordans golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner Suddenly I wasnt thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean hard limited person who dealt in universal scepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement There are only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired And Daisy ought to have something in her life murmured Jordan to me Does she want to see Gatsby Shes not to know about it Gatsby doesnt want her to know Youre just supposed to invite her to tea We passed a barrier of dark trees and then the faade of FiftyNinth Street a block of delicate pale light beamed down into the park Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me tightening my arms Her wan scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again closer this time to my face V When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire Two oclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsbys house lit from tower to cellar At first I thought it was another party a wild rout that had resolved itself into hideandgoseek or sardinesinthebox with all the house thrown open to the game But there wasnt a sound Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn Your place looks like the Worlds Fair I said Does it He turned his eyes toward it absently I have been glancing into some of the rooms Lets go to Coney Island old sport In my car Its too late Well suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool I havent made use of it all summer Ive got to go to bed All right He waited looking at me with suppressed eagerness I talked with Miss Baker I said after a moment Im going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea Oh thats all right he said carelessly I dont want to put you to any trouble What day would suit you What day would suit you he corrected me quickly I dont want to put you to any trouble you see How about the day after tomorrow He considered for a moment Then with reluctance I want to get the grass cut he said We both looked down at the grassthere was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker wellkept expanse of his began I suspected that he meant my grass Theres another little thing he said uncertainly and hesitated Would you rather put it off for a few days I asked Oh it isnt about that At least He fumbled with a series of beginnings Why I thoughtwhy look here old sport you dont make much money do you Not very much This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently I thought you didnt if youll pardon myyou see I carry on a little business on the side a sort of side line you understand And I thought that if you dont make very muchYoure selling bonds arent you old sport Trying to Well this would interest you It wouldnt take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life But because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered I had no choice except to cut him off there Ive got my hands full I said Im much obliged but I couldnt take on any more work You wouldnt have to do any business with Wolfshiem Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the gonnegtion mentioned at lunch but I assured him he was wrong He waited a moment longer hoping Id begin a conversation but I was too absorbed to be responsive so he went unwillingly home The evening had made me lightheaded and happy I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door So I dont know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he glanced into rooms while his house blazed gaudily on I called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea Dont bring Tom I warned her What Dont bring Tom Who is Tom she asked innocently The day agreed upon was pouring rain At eleven oclock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawnmower tapped at my front door and said that Mr Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers The flowers were unnecessary for at two oclock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsbys with innumerable receptacles to contain it An hour later the front door opened nervously and Gatsby in a white flannel suit silver shirt and goldcoloured tie hurried in He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes Is everything all right he asked immediately The grass looks fine if thats what you mean What grass he inquired blankly Oh the grass in the yard He looked out the window at it but judging from his expression I dont believe he saw a thing Looks very good he remarked vaguely One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four I think it was The Journal Have you got everything you need in the shape ofof tea I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop Will they do I asked Of course of course Theyre fine and he added hollowly  old sport The rain cooled about halfpast three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clays Economics starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home Whys that Nobodys coming to tea Its too late He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere I cant wait all day Dont be silly its just two minutes to four He sat down miserably as if I had pushed him and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane We both jumped up and a little harrowed myself I went out into the yard Under the dripping bare lilactrees a large open car was coming up the drive It stopped Daisys face tipped sideways beneath a threecornered lavender hat looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile Is this absolutely where you live my dearest one The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain I had to follow the sound of it for a moment up and down with my ear alone before any words came through A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car Are you in love with me she said low in my ear or why did I have to come alone Thats the secret of Castle Rackrent Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour Come back in an hour Ferdie Then in a grave murmur His name is Ferdie Does the gasoline affect his nose I dont think so she said innocently Why We went in To my overwhelming surprise the livingroom was deserted Well thats funny I exclaimed Whats funny She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door I went out and opened it Gatsby pale as death with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the livingroom It wasnt a bit funny Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain For half a minute there wasnt a sound Then from the livingroom I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisys voice on a clear artificial note I certainly am awfully glad to see you again A pause it endured horribly I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room Gatsby his hands still in his pockets was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease even of boredom His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair Weve met before muttered Gatsby His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place Then he sat down rigidly his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand Im sorry about the clock he said My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn I couldnt muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head Its an old clock I told them idiotically I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor We havent met for many years said Daisy her voice as matteroffact as it could ever be Five years next November The automatic quality of Gatsbys answer set us all back at least another minute I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes However as calmness wasnt an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet Where are you going demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm Ill be back Ive got to speak to you about something before you go He followed me wildly into the kitchen closed the door and whispered Oh God in a miserable way Whats the matter This is a terrible mistake he said shaking his head from side to side a terrible terrible mistake Youre just embarrassed thats all and luckily I added Daisys embarrassed too Shes embarrassed he repeated incredulously Just as much as you are Dont talk so loud Youre acting like a little boy I broke out impatiently Not only that but youre rude Daisys sitting in there all alone He raised his hand to stop my words looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room I walked out the back wayjust as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour beforeand ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn wellshaved by Gatsbys gardener abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsbys enormous house so I stared at it like Kant at his church steeple for half an hour A brewer had built it early in the period craze a decade before and there was a story that hed agreed to pay five years taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Familyhe went into an immediate decline His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door Americans while willing even eager to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocers automobile rounded Gatsbys drive with the raw material for his servants dinnerI felt sure he wouldnt eat a spoonful A maid began opening the upper windows of his house appeared momentarily in each and leaning from the large central bay spat meditatively into the garden It was time I went back While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too I went inafter making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stovebut I dont believe they heard a sound They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air and every vestige of embarrassment was gone Daisys face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding He literally glowed without a word or a gesture of exultation a new wellbeing radiated from him and filled the little room Oh hello old sport he said as if he hadnt seen me for years I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands Its stopped raining Has it When he realized what I was talking about that there were twinklebells of sunshine in the room he smiled like a weather man like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light and repeated the news to Daisy What do you think of that Its stopped raining Im glad Jay Her throat full of aching grieving beauty told only of her unexpected joy I want you and Daisy to come over to my house he said Id like to show her around Youre sure you want me to come Absolutely old sport Daisy went upstairs to wash her facetoo late I thought with humiliation of my towelswhile Gatsby and I waited on the lawn My house looks well doesnt it he demanded See how the whole front of it catches the light I agreed that it was splendid Yes His eyes went over it every arched door and square tower It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it I thought you inherited your money I did old sport he said automatically but I lost most of it in the big panicthe panic of the war I think he hardly knew what he was saying for when I asked him what business he was in he answered Thats my affair before he realized that it wasnt an appropriate reply Oh Ive been in several things he corrected himself I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business But Im not in either one now He looked at me with more attention Do you mean youve been thinking over what I proposed the other night Before I could answer Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight That huge place there she cried pointing Do you like it I love it but I dont see how you live there all alone I keep it always full of interesting people night and day People who do interesting things Celebrated people Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky admired the gardens the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kissmeatthegate It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette musicrooms and Restoration Salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through As Gatsby closed the door of the Merton College Library I could have sworn I heard the owleyed man break into ghostly laughter We went upstairs through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers through dressingrooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunken bathsintruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor It was Mr Klipspringer the boarder I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning Finally we came to Gatsbys own apartment a bedroom and a bath and an Adams study where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall He hadnt once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her wellloved eyes Sometimes too he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs His bedroom was the simplest room of allexcept where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh Its the funniest thing old sport he said hilariously I cantWhen I try to He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence He had been full of the idea so long dreamed it right through to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at an inconceivable pitch of intensity Now in the reaction he was running down like an overwound clock Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressinggowns and ties and his shirts piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high Ive got a man in England who buys me clothes He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season spring and fall He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in manycoloured disarray While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted highershirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and applegreen and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily Theyre such beautiful shirts she sobbed her voice muffled in the thick folds It makes me sad because Ive never seen suchsuch beautiful shirts before  After the house we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowersbut outside Gatsbys window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound If it wasnt for the mist we could see your home across the bay said Gatsby You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her almost touching her It had seemed as close as a star to the moon Now it was again a green light on a dock His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one I began to walk about the room examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me hung on the wall over his desk Whos this That Thats Mr Dan Cody old sport The name sounded faintly familiar Hes dead now He used to be my best friend years ago There was a small picture of Gatsby also in yachting costume on the bureauGatsby with his head thrown back defiantlytaken apparently when he was about eighteen I adore it exclaimed Daisy The pompadour You never told me you had a pompadouror a yacht Look at this said Gatsby quickly Heres a lot of clippingsabout you They stood side by side examining it I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver Yes  Well I cant talk now  I cant talk now old sport  I said a small town  He must know what a small town is  Well hes no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town  He rang off Come here quick cried Daisy at the window The rain was still falling but the darkness had parted in the west and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea Look at that she whispered and then after a moment Id like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around I tried to go then but they wouldnt hear of it perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone I know what well do said Gatsby well have Klipspringer play the piano He went out of the room calling Ewing and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed slightly worn young man with shellrimmed glasses and scanty blond hair He was now decently clothed in a sport shirt open at the neck sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue Did we interrupt your exercise inquired Daisy politely I was asleep cried Mr Klipspringer in a spasm of embarrassment That is Id been asleep Then I got up  Klipspringer plays the piano said Gatsby cutting him off Dont you Ewing old sport I dont play well I donthardly play at all Im all out of prac Well go downstairs interrupted Gatsby He flipped a switch The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light In the musicroom Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano He lit Daisys cigarette from a trembling match and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom Im all out of practice you see I told you I couldnt play Im all out of prac Dont talk so much old sport commanded Gatsby Play In the morning In the evening Aint we got fun Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound All the lights were going on in West Egg now the electric trains mencarrying were plunging home through the rain from New York It was the hour of a profound human change and excitement was generating on the air One things sure and nothings surer The rich get richer and the poor getchildren In the meantime In between time As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsbys face as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness Almost five years There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreamsnot through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion It had gone beyond her beyond everything He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion adding to it all the time decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart As I watched him he adjusted himself a little visibly His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating feverish warmth because it couldnt be overdreamedthat voice was a deathless song They had forgotten me but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand Gatsby didnt know me now at all I looked once more at them and they looked back at me remotely possessed by intense life Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain leaving them there together VI About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsbys door and asked him if he had anything to say Anything to say about what inquired Gatsby politely Whyany statement to give out It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsbys name around his office in a connection which he either wouldnt reveal or didnt fully understand This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out to see It was a random shot and yet the reporters instinct was right Gatsbys notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news Contemporary legends such as the underground pipeline to Canada attached themselves to him and there was one persistent story that he didnt live in a house at all but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota isnt easy to say James Gatzthat was really or at least legally his name He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his careerwhen he saw Dan Codys yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat pulled out to the Tuolomee and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour I suppose hed had the name ready for a long time even then His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peoplehis imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg Long Island sprang from his Platonic conception of himself He was a son of Goda phrase which if it means anything means just thatand he must be about His Fathers business the service of a vast vulgar and meretricious beauty So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeenyearold boy would be likely to invent and to this conception he was faithful to the end For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clamdigger and a salmonfisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed His brown hardening body lived naturally through the halffierce halflazy work of the bracing days He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them of young virgins because they were ignorant of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming selfabsorption he took for granted But his heart was in a constant turbulent riot The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairys wing An instinct toward his future glory had led him some months before to the small Lutheran College of St Olafs in southern Minnesota He stayed there two weeks dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny to destiny itself and despising the janitors work with which he was to pay his way through Then he drifted back to Lake Superior and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Codys yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore Cody was fifty years old then a product of the Nevada silver fields of the Yukon of every rush for metal since seventyfive The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of softmindedness and suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye the newspaper woman played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht were common property of the turgid journalism in  He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatzs destiny in Little Girl Bay To young Gatz resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world I suppose he smiled at Codyhe had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled At any rate Cody asked him a few questions one of them elicited the brand new name and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat six pairs of white duck trousers and a yachting cap And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too He was employed in a vague personal capacitywhile he remained with Cody he was in turn steward mate skipper secretary and even jailor for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the Continent It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsbys bedroom a grey florid man with a hard empty facethe pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone And it was from Cody that he inherited moneya legacy of twentyfive thousand dollars He didnt get it He never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye He was left with his singularly appropriate education the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man  He told me all this very much later but Ive put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents which werent even faintly true Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him So I take advantage of this short halt while Gatsby so to speak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptions away It was a halt too in my association with his affairs For several weeks I didnt see him or hear his voice on the phonemostly I was in New York trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile auntbut finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon I hadnt been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink I was startled naturally but the really surprising thing was that it hadnt happened before They were a party of three on horsebackTom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown ridinghabit who had been there previously Im delighted to see you said Gatsby standing on his porch Im delighted that you dropped in As though they cared Sit right down Have a cigarette or a cigar He walked around the room quickly ringing bells Ill have something to drink for you in just a minute He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for Mr Sloane wanted nothing A lemonade No thanks A little champagne Nothing at all thanks  Im sorry Did you have a nice ride Very good roads around here I suppose the automobiles Yeah Moved by an irresistible impulse Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger I believe weve met somewhere before Mr Buchanan Oh yes said Tom gruffly polite but obviously not remembering So we did I remember very well About two weeks ago Thats right You were with Nick here I know your wife continued Gatsby almost aggressively That so Tom turned to me You live near here Nick Next door That so Mr Sloane didnt enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing eitheruntil unexpectedly after two highballs she became cordial Well all come over to your next party Mr Gatsby she suggested What do you say Certainly Id be delighted to have you Be ver nice said Mr Sloane without gratitude Wellthink ought to be starting home Please dont hurry Gatsby urged them He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom Why dont youwhy dont you stay for supper I wouldnt be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York You come to supper with me said the lady enthusiastically Both of you This included me Mr Sloane got to his feet Come along he saidbut to her only I mean it she insisted Id love to have you Lots of room Gatsby looked at me questioningly He wanted to go and he didnt see that Mr Sloane had determined he shouldnt Im afraid I wont be able to I said Well you come she urged concentrating on Gatsby Mr Sloane murmured something close to her ear We wont be late if we start now she insisted aloud I havent got a horse said Gatsby I used to ride in the army but Ive never bought a horse Ill have to follow you in my car Excuse me for just a minute The rest of us walked out on the porch where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside My God I believe the mans coming said Tom Doesnt he know she doesnt want him She says she does want him She has a big dinner party and he wont know a soul there He frowned I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy By God I may be oldfashioned in my ideas but women run around too much these days to suit me They meet all kinds of crazy fish Suddenly Mr Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses Come on said Mr Sloane to Tom were late Weve got to go And then to me Tell him we couldnt wait will you Tom and I shook hands the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisys running around alone for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsbys party Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressivenessit stands out in my memory from Gatsbys other parties that summer There were the same people or at least the same sort of people the same profusion of champagne the same manycoloured manykeyed commotion but I felt an unpleasantness in the air a pervading harshness that hadnt been there before Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself with its own standards and its own great figures second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so and now I was looking at it again through Daisys eyes It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisys voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat These things excite me so she whispered If you want to kiss me any time during the evening Nick just let me know and Ill be glad to arrange it for you Just mention my name Or present a green card Im giving out green Look around suggested Gatsby Im looking around Im having a marvellous You must see the faces of many people youve heard about Toms arrogant eyes roamed the crowd We dont go around very much he said in fact I was just thinking I dont know a soul here Perhaps you know that lady Gatsby indicated a gorgeous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a whiteplum tree Tom and Daisy stared with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies Shes lovely said Daisy The man bending over her is her director He took them ceremoniously from group to group Mrs Buchanan  and Mr Buchanan After an instants hesitation he added the polo player Oh no objected Tom quickly not me But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained the polo player for the rest of the evening Ive never met so many celebrities Daisy exclaimed I liked that manwhat was his namewith the sort of blue nose Gatsby identified him adding that he was a small producer Well I liked him anyhow Id a little rather not be the polo player said Tom pleasantly Id rather look at all these famous people inin oblivion Daisy and Gatsby danced I remember being surprised by his graceful conservative foxtrotI had never seen him dance before Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden In case theres a fire or a flood she explained or any act of God Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together Do you mind if I eat with some people over here he said A fellows getting off some funny stuff Go ahead answered Daisy genially and if you want to take down any addresses heres my little gold pencil  She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty and I knew that except for the halfhour shed been alone with Gatsby she wasnt having a good time We were at a particularly tipsy table That was my faultGatsby had been called to the phone and Id enjoyed these same people only two weeks before But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now How do you feel Miss Baedeker The girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slump against my shoulder At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes Wha A massive and lethargic woman who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow spoke in Miss Baedekers defence Oh shes all right now When shes had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that I tell her she ought to leave it alone I do leave it alone affirmed the accused hollowly We heard you yelling so I said to Doc Civet here Theres somebody that needs your help Doc  Shes much obliged Im sure said another friend without gratitude but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool mumbled Miss Baedeker They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey Then you ought to leave it alone countered Doctor Civet Speak for yourself cried Miss Baedeker violently Your hand shakes I wouldnt let you operate on me It was like that Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the movingpicture director and his Star They were still under the whiteplum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek I like her said Daisy I think shes lovely But the rest offended herand inarguably because it wasnt a gesture but an emotion She was appalled by West Egg this unprecedented place that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing villageappalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car It was dark here in front only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressingroom blind above gave way to another shadow an indefinite procession of shadows who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass Who is this Gatsby anyhow demanded Tom suddenly Some big bootlegger Whered you hear that I inquired I didnt hear it I imagined it A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers you know Not Gatsby I said shortly He was silent for a moment The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet Well he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisys fur collar At least they are more interesting than the people we know she said with an effort You didnt look so interested Well I was Tom laughed and turned to me Did you notice Daisys face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it in a way contralto voices have and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air Lots of people come who havent been invited she said suddenly That girl hadnt been invited They simply force their way in and hes too polite to object Id like to know who he is and what he does insisted Tom And I think Ill make a point of finding out I can tell you right now she answered He owned some drugstores a lot of drugstores He built them up himself The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive Good night Nick said Daisy Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where Three OClock in the Morning a neat sad little waltz of that year was drifting out the open door After all in the very casualness of Gatsbys party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby one moment of magical encounter would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion I stayed late that night Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up chilled and exalted from the black beach until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and his eyes were bright and tired She didnt like it he said immediately Of course she did She didnt like it he insisted She didnt have a good time He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression I feel far away from her he said Its hard to make her understand You mean about the dance The dance He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers Old sport the dance is unimportant He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say I never loved you After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken One of them was that after she was free they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her housejust as if it were five years ago And she doesnt understand he said She used to be able to understand Wed sit for hours He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers I wouldnt ask too much of her I ventured You cant repeat the past Cant repeat the past he cried incredulously Why of course you can He looked around him wildly as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of his hand Im going to fix everything just the way it was before he said nodding determinedly Shell see He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something some idea of himself perhaps that had gone into loving Daisy His life had been confused and disordered since then but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly he could find out what that thing was   One autumn night five years before they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight They stopped here and turned toward each other Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the treeshe could climb to it if he climbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap of life gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder His heart beat faster as Daisys white face came up to his own He knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of God So he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuningfork that had been struck upon a star Then he kissed her At his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete Through all he said even through his appalling sentimentality I was reminded of somethingan elusive rhythm a fragment of lost words that I had heard somewhere a long time ago For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb mans as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever VII It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightand as obscurely as it had begun his career as Trimalchio was over Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away Wondering if he were sick I went over to find outan unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door Is Mr Gatsby sick Nope After a pause he added sir in a dilatory grudging way I hadnt seen him around and I was rather worried Tell him Mr Carraway came over Who he demanded rudely Carraway Carraway All right Ill tell him Abruptly he slammed the door My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty and the general opinion in the village was that the new people werent servants at all Next day Gatsby called me on the phone Going away I inquired No old sport I hear you fired all your servants I wanted somebody who wouldnt gossip Daisy comes over quite oftenin the afternoons So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes Theyre some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for Theyre all brothers and sisters They used to run a small hotel I see He was calling up at Daisys requestwould I come to lunch at her house tomorrow Miss Baker would be there Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming Something was up And yet I couldnt believe that they would choose this occasion for a sceneespecially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden The next day was broiling almost the last certainly the warmest of the summer As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist and then as her newspaper dampened under her fingers lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry Her pocketbook slapped to the floor Oh my she gasped I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her holding it at arms length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon itbut everyone near by including the woman suspected me just the same Hot said the conductor to familiar faces Some weather  Hot  Hot  Hot  Is it hot enough for you Is it hot Is it   My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart  Through the hall of the Buchanans house blew a faint wind carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door The masters body roared the butler into the mouthpiece Im sorry madame but we cant furnish itits far too hot to touch this noon What he really said was Yes  Yes  Ill see He set down the receiver and came toward us glistening slightly to take our stiff straw hats Madame expects you in the salon he cried needlessly indicating the direction In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life The room shadowed well with awnings was dark and cool Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans We cant move they said together Jordans fingers powdered white over their tan rested for a moment in mine And Mr Thomas Buchanan the athlete I inquired Simultaneously I heard his voice gruff muffled husky at the hall telephone Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes Daisy watched him and laughed her sweet exciting laugh a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air The rumour is whispered Jordan that thats Toms girl on the telephone We were silent The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance Very well then I wont sell you the car at all  Im under no obligations to you at all  and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I wont stand that at all Holding down the receiver said Daisy cynically No hes not I assured her Its a bonafide deal I happen to know about it Tom flung open the door blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body and hurried into the room Mr Gatsby He put out his broad flat hand with wellconcealed dislike Im glad to see you sir  Nick  Make us a cold drink cried Daisy As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth You know I love you she murmured You forget theres a lady present said Jordan Daisy looked around doubtfully You kiss Nick too What a low vulgar girl I dont care cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room Blessed precious she crooned holding out her arms Come to your own mother that loves you The child relinquished by the nurse rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mothers dress The blessed precious Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair Stand up now and sayHowdedo Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise I dont think he had ever really believed in its existence before I got dressed before luncheon said the child turning eagerly to Daisy Thats because your mother wanted to show you off Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck You dream you You absolute little dream Yes admitted the child calmly Aunt Jordans got on a white dress too How do you like mothers friends Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby Do you think theyre pretty Wheres Daddy She doesnt look like her father explained Daisy She looks like me Shes got my hair and shape of the face Daisy sat back upon the couch The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand Come Pammy Goodbye sweetheart With a reluctant backward glance the welldisciplined child held to her nurses hand and was pulled out the door just as Tom came back preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice Gatsby took up his drink They certainly look cool he said with visible tension We drank in long greedy swallows I read somewhere that the suns getting hotter every year said Tom genially It seems that pretty soon the earths going to fall into the sunor wait a minuteits just the oppositethe suns getting colder every year Come outside he suggested to Gatsby Id like you to have a look at the place I went with them out to the veranda On the green Sound stagnant in the heat one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea Gatsbys eyes followed it momentarily he raised his hand and pointed across the bay Im right across from you So you are Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dogdays alongshore Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles Theres sport for you said Tom nodding Id like to be out there with him for about an hour We had luncheon in the diningroom darkened too against the heat and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale Whatll we do with ourselves this afternoon cried Daisy and the day after that and the next thirty years Dont be morbid Jordan said Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall But its so hot insisted Daisy on the verge of tears and everythings so confused Lets all go to town Her voice struggled on through the heat beating against it moulding its senselessness into forms Ive heard of making a garage out of a stable Tom was saying to Gatsby but Im the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage Who wants to go to town demanded Daisy insistently Gatsbys eyes floated toward her Ah she cried you look so cool Their eyes met and they stared together at each other alone in space With an effort she glanced down at the table You always look so cool she repeated She had told him that she loved him and Tom Buchanan saw He was astounded His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago You resemble the advertisement of the man she went on innocently You know the advertisement of the man All right broke in Tom quickly Im perfectly willing to go to town Come onwere all going to town He got up his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife No one moved Come on His temper cracked a little Whats the matter anyhow If were going to town lets start His hand trembling with his effort at selfcontrol bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale Daisys voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive Are we just going to go she objected Like this Arent we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first Everybody smoked all through lunch Oh lets have fun she begged him Its too hot to fuss He didnt answer Have it your own way she said Come on Jordan They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky Gatsby started to speak changed his mind but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly Have you got your stables here asked Gatsby with an effort About a quarter of a mile down the road Oh A pause I dont see the idea of going to town broke out Tom savagely Women get these notions in their heads Shall we take anything to drink called Daisy from an upper window Ill get some whisky answered Tom He went inside Gatsby turned to me rigidly I cant say anything in his house old sport Shes got an indiscreet voice I remarked Its full of I hesitated Her voice is full of money he said suddenly That was it Id never understood before It was full of moneythat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it the jingle of it the cymbals song of it  High in a white palace the kings daughter the golden girl  Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms Shall we all go in my car suggested Gatsby He felt the hot green leather of the seat I ought to have left it in the shade Is it standard shift demanded Tom Yes Well you take my coup and let me drive your car to town The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby I dont think theres much gas he objected Plenty of gas said Tom boisterously He looked at the gauge And if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore You can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays A pause followed this apparently pointless remark Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable as if I had only heard it described in words passed over Gatsbys face Come on Daisy said Tom pressing her with his hand toward Gatsbys car Ill take you in this circus wagon He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm You take Nick and Jordan Well follow you in the coup She walked close to Gatsby touching his coat with her hand Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsbys car Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind Did you see that demanded Tom See what He looked at me keenly realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along You think Im pretty dumb dont you he suggested Perhaps I am but I have aalmost a second sight sometimes that tells me what to do Maybe you dont believe that but science He paused The immediate contingency overtook him pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss Ive made a small investigation of this fellow he continued I could have gone deeper if Id known Do you mean youve been to a medium inquired Jordan humorously What Confused he stared at us as we laughed A medium About Gatsby About Gatsby No I havent I said Id been making a small investigation of his past And you found he was an Oxford man said Jordan helpfully An Oxford man He was incredulous Like hell he is He wears a pink suit Nevertheless hes an Oxford man Oxford New Mexico snorted Tom contemptuously or something like that Listen Tom If youre such a snob why did you invite him to lunch demanded Jordan crossly Daisy invited him she knew him before we were marriedGod knows where We were all irritable now with the fading ale and aware of it we drove for a while in silence Then as Doctor T J Eckleburgs faded eyes came into sight down the road I remembered Gatsbys caution about gasoline Weve got enough to get us to town said Tom But theres a garage right here objected Jordan I dont want to get stalled in this baking heat Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilsons sign After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed holloweyed at the car Lets have some gas cried Tom roughly What do you think we stopped forto admire the view Im sick said Wilson without moving Been sick all day Whats the matter Im all run down Well shall I help myself Tom demanded You sounded well enough on the phone With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and breathing hard unscrewed the cap of the tank In the sunlight his face was green I didnt mean to interrupt your lunch he said But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car How do you like this one inquired Tom I bought it last week Its a nice yellow one said Wilson as he strained at the handle Like to buy it Big chance Wilson smiled faintly No but I could make some money on the other What do you want money for all of a sudden Ive been here too long I want to get away My wife and I want to go West Your wife does exclaimed Tom startled Shes been talking about it for ten years He rested for a moment against the pump shading his eyes And now shes going whether she wants to or not Im going to get her away The coup flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand What do I owe you demanded Tom harshly I just got wised up to something funny the last two days remarked Wilson Thats why I want to get away Thats why I been bothering you about the car What do I owe you Dollar twenty The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadnt alighted on Tom He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick I stared at him and then at Tom who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour beforeand it occurred to me that there was no difference between men in intelligence or race so profound as the difference between the sick and the well Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty unforgivably guiltyas if he had just got some poor girl with child Ill let you have that car said Tom Ill send it over tomorrow afternoon That locality was always vaguely disquieting even in the broad glare of afternoon and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived after a moment that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture Her expression was curiously familiarit was an expression I had often seen on womens faces but on Myrtle Wilsons face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes wide with jealous terror were fixed not on Tom but on Jordan Baker whom she took to be his wife  There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic His wife and his mistress until an hour ago secure and inviolate were slipping precipitately from his control Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour until among the spidery girders of the elevated we came in sight of the easygoing blue coup Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool suggested Jordan I love New York on summer afternoons when everyones away Theres something very sensuous about itoverripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands The word sensuous had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coup came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside Where are we going she cried How about the movies Its so hot she complained You go Well ride around and meet you after With an effort her wit rose faintly Well meet you on some corner Ill be the man smoking two cigarettes We cant argue about it here Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us You follow me to the south side of Central Park in front of the Plaza Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight I think he was afraid they would dart down a sidestreet and out of his life forever But they didnt And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me though I have a sharp physical memory that in the course of it my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back The notion originated with Daisys suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep Each of us said over and over that it was a crazy ideawe all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought or pretended to think that we were being very funny  The room was large and stifling and though it was already four oclock opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us fixing her hair Its a swell suite whispered Jordan respectfully and everyone laughed Open another window commanded Daisy without turning around There arent any more Well wed better telephone for an axe The thing to do is to forget about the heat said Tom impatiently You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table Why not let her alone old sport remarked Gatsby Youre the one that wanted to come to town There was a moment of silence The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor whereupon Jordan whispered Excuse mebut this time no one laughed Ill pick it up I offered Ive got it Gatsby examined the parted string muttered Hum in an interested way and tossed the book on a chair Thats a great expression of yours isnt it said Tom sharply What is All this old sport business Whered you pick that up Now see here Tom said Daisy turning around from the mirror if youre going to make personal remarks I wont stay here a minute Call up and order some ice for the mint julep As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohns Wedding March from the ballroom below Imagine marrying anybody in this heat cried Jordan dismally StillI was married in the middle of June Daisy remembered Louisville in June Somebody fainted Who was it fainted Tom Biloxi he answered shortly A man named Biloxi Blocks Biloxi and he made boxesthats a factand he was from Biloxi Tennessee They carried him into my house appended Jordan because we lived just two doors from the church And he stayed three weeks until Daddy told him he had to get out The day after he left Daddy died After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent There wasnt any connection I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis I remarked That was his cousin I knew his whole family history before he left He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window followed by intermittent cries of Yeaeaea and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began Were getting old said Daisy If we were young wed rise and dance Remember Biloxi Jordan warned her Whered you know him Tom Biloxi He concentrated with an effort I didnt know him He was a friend of Daisys He was not she denied Id never seen him before He came down in the private car Well he said he knew you He said he was raised in Louisville Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him Jordan smiled He was probably bumming his way home He told me he was president of your class at Yale Tom and I looked at each other blankly Biloxi First place we didnt have any president Gatsbys foot beat a short restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly By the way Mr Gatsby I understand youre an Oxford man Not exactly Oh yes I understand you went to Oxford YesI went there A pause Then Toms voice incredulous and insulting You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven Another pause A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his thank you and the soft closing of the door This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last I told you I went there said Gatsby I heard you but Id like to know when It was in nineteennineteen I only stayed five months Thats why I cant really call myself an Oxford man Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief But we were all looking at Gatsby It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice he continued We could go to any of the universities in England or France I wanted to get up and slap him on the back I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that Id experienced before Daisy rose smiling faintly and went to the table Open the whisky Tom she ordered and Ill make you a mint julep Then you wont seem so stupid to yourself  Look at the mint Wait a minute snapped Tom I want to ask Mr Gatsby one more question Go on Gatsby said politely What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content He isnt causing a row Daisy looked desperately from one to the other Youre causing a row Please have a little selfcontrol Selfcontrol repeated Tom incredulously I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife Well if thats the idea you can count me out  Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next theyll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization Were all white here murmured Jordan I know Im not very popular I dont give big parties I suppose youve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friendsin the modern world Angry as I was as we all were I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth The transition from libertine to prig was so complete Ive got something to tell you old sport began Gatsby But Daisy guessed at his intention Please dont she interrupted helplessly Please lets all go home Why dont we all go home Thats a good idea I got up Come on Tom Nobody wants a drink I want to know what Mr Gatsby has to tell me Your wife doesnt love you said Gatsby Shes never loved you She loves me You must be crazy exclaimed Tom automatically Gatsby sprang to his feet vivid with excitement She never loved you do you hear he cried She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me It was a terrible mistake but in her heart she never loved anyone except me At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remainas though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions Sit down Daisy Toms voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note Whats been going on I want to hear all about it I told you whats been going on said Gatsby Going on for five yearsand you didnt know Tom turned to Daisy sharply Youve been seeing this fellow for five years Not seeing said Gatsby No we couldnt meet But both of us loved each other all that time old sport and you didnt know I used to laugh sometimesbut there was no laughter in his eyesto think that you didnt know Ohthats all Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair Youre crazy he exploded I cant speak about what happened five years ago because I didnt know Daisy thenand Ill be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door But all the rest of thats a God damned lie Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now No said Gatsby shaking his head She does though The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesnt know what shes doing He nodded sagely And whats more I love Daisy too Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself but I always come back and in my heart I love her all the time Youre revolting said Daisy She turned to me and her voice dropping an octave lower filled the room with thrilling scorn Do you know why we left Chicago Im surprised that they didnt treat you to the story of that little spree Gatsby walked over and stood beside her Daisy thats all over now he said earnestly It doesnt matter any more Just tell him the truththat you never loved himand its all wiped out forever She looked at him blindly Whyhow could I love himpossibly You never loved him She hesitated Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal as though she realized at last what she was doingand as though she had never all along intended doing anything at all But it was done now It was too late I never loved him she said with perceptible reluctance Not at Kapiolani demanded Tom suddenly No From the ballroom beneath muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry There was a husky tenderness in his tone  Daisy Please dont Her voice was cold but the rancour was gone from it She looked at Gatsby There Jay she saidbut her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet Oh you want too much she cried to Gatsby I love you nowisnt that enough I cant help whats past She began to sob helplessly I did love him oncebut I loved you too Gatsbys eyes opened and closed You loved me too he repeated Even thats a lie said Tom savagely She didnt know you were alive Whytheres things between Daisy and me that youll never know things that neither of us can ever forget The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby I want to speak to Daisy alone he insisted Shes all excited now Even alone I cant say I never loved Tom she admitted in a pitiful voice It wouldnt be true Of course it wouldnt agreed Tom She turned to her husband As if it mattered to you she said Of course it matters Im going to take better care of you from now on You dont understand said Gatsby with a touch of panic Youre not going to take care of her any more Im not Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed He could afford to control himself now Whys that Daisys leaving you Nonsense I am though she said with a visible effort Shes not leaving me Toms words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby Certainly not for a common swindler whod have to steal the ring he put on her finger I wont stand this cried Daisy Oh please lets get out Who are you anyhow broke out Tom Youre one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiemthat much I happen to know Ive made a little investigation into your affairsand Ill carry it further tomorrow You can suit yourself about that old sport said Gatsby steadily I found out what your drugstores were He turned to us and spoke rapidly He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of sidestreet drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter Thats one of his little stunts I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasnt far wrong What about it said Gatsby politely I guess your friend Walter Chase wasnt too proud to come in on it And you left him in the lurch didnt you You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey God You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you He came to us dead broke He was very glad to pick up some money old sport Dont you call me old sport cried Tom Gatsby said nothing Walter could have you up on the betting laws too but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsbys face That drugstore business was just small change continued Tom slowly but youve got something on now that Walters afraid to tell me about I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin Then I turned back to Gatsbyand was startled at his expression He lookedand this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his gardenas if he had killed a man For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way It passed and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy denying everything defending his name against accusations that had not been made But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away trying to touch what was no longer tangible struggling unhappily undespairingly toward that lost voice across the room The voice begged again to go Please Tom I cant stand this any more Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions whatever courage she had had were definitely gone You two start on home Daisy said Tom In Mr Gatsbys car She looked at Tom alarmed now but he insisted with magnanimous scorn Go on He wont annoy you I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over They were gone without a word snapped out made accidental isolated like ghosts even from our pity After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel Want any of this stuff Jordan  Nick I didnt answer Nick He asked again What Want any No  I just remembered that todays my birthday I was thirty Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade It was seven oclock when we got into the coup with him and started for Long Island Tom talked incessantly exulting and laughing but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind Thirtythe promise of a decade of loneliness a thinning list of single men to know a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm thinning hair But there was Jordan beside me who unlike Daisy was too wise ever to carry wellforgotten dreams from age to age As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coats shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight  The young Greek Michaelis who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest He had slept through the heat until after five when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his officereally sick pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson refused saying that hed miss a lot of business if he did While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead Ive got my wife locked in up there explained Wilson calmly Shes going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then were going to move away Michaelis was astonished they had been neighbours for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement Generally he was one of these wornout men when he wasnt working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable colourless way He was his wifes man and not his own So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened but Wilson wouldnt say a wordinstead he began to throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what hed been doing at certain times on certain days Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away intending to come back later But he didnt He supposed he forgot to thats all When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs Wilsons voice loud and scolding downstairs in the garage Beat me he heard her cry Throw me down and beat me you dirty little coward A moment later she rushed out into the dusk waving her hands and shoutingbefore he could move from his door the business was over The death car as the newspapers called it didnt stop it came out of the gathering darkness wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend Mavro Michaelis wasnt even sure of its colourhe told the first policeman that it was light green The other car the one going toward New York came to rest a hundred yards beyond and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson her life violently extinguished knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long  We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away Wreck said Tom Thats good Wilsonll have a little business at last He slowed down but still without any intention of stopping until as we came nearer the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes Well take a look he said doubtfully just a look I became aware now of a hollow wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage a sound which as we got out of the coup and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words Oh my God uttered over and over in a gasping moan Theres some bad trouble here said Tom excitedly He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation it was a minute before I could see anything at all Then new arrivals deranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside Myrtle Wilsons body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a worktable by the wall and Tom with his back to us was bending over it motionless Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book At first I couldnt find the source of the high groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garagethen I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder but Wilson neither heard nor saw His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call Oh my Gaod Oh my Gaod Oh Gaod Oh my Gaod Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman Mav the policeman was saying o No r corrected the man Mavro Listen to me muttered Tom fiercely r said the policeman o g g He looked up as Toms broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder What you want fella What happenedthats what I want to know Auto hit her Insantly killed Instantly killed repeated Tom staring She ran out ina road Sonofabitch didnt even stopus car There was two cars said Michaelis one comin one goin see Going where asked the policeman keenly One goin each way Well shehis hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his sideshe ran out there an the one comin from NYork knock right into her goin thirty or forty miles an hour Whats the name of this place here demanded the officer Hasnt got any name A pale welldressed negro stepped near It was a yellow car he said big yellow car New See the accident asked the policeman No but the car passed me down the road going fastern forty Going fifty sixty Come here and lets have your name Look out now I want to get his name Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying in the office door for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries You dont have to tell me what kind of car it was I know what kind of car it was Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms Youve got to pull yourself together he said with soothing gruffness Wilsons eyes fell upon Tom he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright Listen said Tom shaking him a little I just got here a minute ago from New York I was bringing you that coup weve been talking about That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasnt minedo you hear I havent seen it all afternoon Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes Whats all that he demanded Im a friend of his Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilsons body He says he knows the car that did it  It was a yellow car Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom And what colours your car Its a blue car a coup Weve come straight from New York I said Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away Now if youll let me have that name again correct Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office set him down in a chair and came back If somebodyll come here and sit with him he snapped authoritatively He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step his eyes avoiding the table As he passed close to me he whispered Lets get out Selfconsciously with his authoritative arms breaking the way we pushed through the still gathering crowd passing a hurried doctor case in hand who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bendthen his foot came down hard and the coup raced along through the night In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face The God damned coward he whimpered He didnt even stop his car  The Buchanans house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines Daisys home he said As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly I ought to have dropped you in West Egg Nick Theres nothing we can do tonight A change had come over him and he spoke gravely and with decision As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases Ill telephone for a taxi to take you home and while youre waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supperif you want any He opened the door Come in No thanks But Id be glad if youd order me the taxi Ill wait outside Jordan put her hand on my arm Wont you come in Nick No thanks I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone But Jordan lingered for a moment more Its only halfpast nine she said Id be damned if Id go in Id had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butlers voice calling a taxi Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate I hadnt gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon What are you doing I inquired Just standing here old sport Somehow that seemed a despicable occupation For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment I wouldnt have been surprised to see sinister faces the faces of Wolfshiems people behind him in the dark shrubbery Did you see any trouble on the road he asked after a minute Yes He hesitated Was she killed Yes I thought so I told Daisy I thought so Its better that the shock should all come at once She stood it pretty well He spoke as if Daisys reaction was the only thing that mattered I got to West Egg by a side road he went on and left the car in my garage I dont think anybody saw us but of course I cant be sure I disliked him so much by this time that I didnt find it necessary to tell him he was wrong Who was the woman he inquired Her name was Wilson Her husband owns the garage How the devil did it happen Well I tried to swing the wheel He broke off and suddenly I guessed at the truth Was Daisy driving Yes he said after a moment but of course Ill say I was You see when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to driveand this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us thought we were somebody she knew Well first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car and then she lost her nerve and turned back The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shockit must have killed her instantly It ripped her open Dont tell me old sport He winced AnyhowDaisy stepped on it I tried to make her stop but she couldnt so I pulled on the emergency brake Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on Shell be all right tomorrow he said presently Im just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon Shes locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality shes going to turn the light out and on again He wont touch her I said Hes not thinking about her I dont trust him old sport How long are you going to wait All night if necessary Anyhow till they all go to bed A new point of view occurred to me Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving He might think he saw a connection in ithe might think anything I looked at the house there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisys room on the ground floor You wait here I said Ill see if theres any sign of a commotion I walked back along the border of the lawn traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps The drawingroom curtains were open and I saw that the room was empty Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement They werent happy and neither of them had touched the chicken or the aleand yet they werent unhappy either There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive Is it all quiet up there he asked anxiously Yes its all quiet I hesitated Youd better come home and get some sleep He shook his head I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed Good night old sport He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlightwatching over nothing VIII I couldnt sleep all night a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound and I tossed halfsick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsbys drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dressI felt that I had something to tell him something to warn him about and morning would be too late Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall heavy with dejection or sleep Nothing happened he said wanly I waited and about four oclock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switchesonce I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadnt been aired for many days I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside Throwing open the French windows of the drawingroom we sat smoking out into the darkness You ought to go away I said Its pretty certain theyll trace your car Go away now old sport Go to Atlantic City for a week or up to Montreal He wouldnt consider it He couldnt possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do He was clutching at some last hope and I couldnt bear to shake him free It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Codytold it to me because Jay Gatsby had broken up like glass against Toms hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out I think that he would have acknowledged anything now without reserve but he wanted to talk about Daisy She was the first nice girl he had ever known In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between He found her excitingly desirable He went to her house at first with other officers from Camp Taylor then alone It amazed himhe had never been in such a beautiful house before But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived thereit was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him There was a ripe mystery about it a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this years shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisyit increased her value in his eyes He felt their presence all about the house pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions But he knew that he was in Daisys house by a colossal accident However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby he was at present a penniless young man without a past and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders So he made the most of his time He took what he could get ravenously and unscrupulouslyeventually he took Daisy one still October night took her because he had no real right to touch her hand He might have despised himself for he had certainly taken her under false pretences I dont mean that he had traded on his phantom millions but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herselfthat he was fully able to take care of her As a matter of fact he had no such facilitieshe had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world But he didnt despise himself and it didnt turn out as he had imagined He had intended probably to take what he could and gobut now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didnt realize just how extraordinary a nice girl could be She vanished into her rich house into her rich full life leaving Gatsbynothing He felt married to her that was all When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless who was somehow betrayed Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of starshine the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy gleaming like silver safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor  I cant describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her old sport I even hoped for a while that shed throw me over but she didnt because she was in love with me too She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her  Well there I was way off my ambitions getting deeper in love every minute and all of a sudden I didnt care What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long silent time It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coats shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers gently as though she were asleep  He did extraordinarily well in the war He was a captain before he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machineguns After the armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead He was worried nowthere was a quality of nervous despair in Daisys letters She didnt see why he couldnt come She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the Beale Street Blues while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an eveningdress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed And all the time something within her was crying for a decision She wanted her life shaped now immediatelyand the decision must be made by some forceof love of money of unquestionable practicalitythat was close at hand That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford  It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs filling the house with greyturning goldturning light The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves There was a slow pleasant movement in the air scarcely a wind promising a cool lovely day I dont think she ever loved him Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly You must remember old sport she was very excited this afternoon He told her those things in a way that frightened herthat made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying He sat down gloomily Of course she might have loved him just for a minute when they were first marriedand loved me more even then do you see Suddenly he came out with a curious remark In any case he said it was just personal What could you make of that except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldnt be measured He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay He stayed there a week walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the outoftheway places to which they had driven in her white car Just as Daisys house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself even though she was gone from it was pervaded with a melancholy beauty He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found herthat he was leaving her behind The daycoachhe was penniless nowwas hot He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a foldingchair and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by Then out into the spring fields where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which as it sank lower seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it the freshest and the best forever It was nine oclock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air The gardener the last one of Gatsbys former servants came to the foot of the steps Im going to drain the pool today Mr Gatsby Leavesll start falling pretty soon and then theres always trouble with the pipes Dont do it today Gatsby answered He turned to me apologetically You know old sport Ive never used that pool all summer I looked at my watch and stood up Twelve minutes to my train I didnt want to go to the city I wasnt worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than thatI didnt want to leave Gatsby I missed that train and then another before I could get myself away Ill call you up I said finally Do old sport Ill call you about noon We walked slowly down the steps I suppose Daisyll call too He looked at me anxiously as if he hoped Id corroborate this I suppose so Well goodbye We shook hands and I started away Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around Theyre a rotten crowd I shouted across the lawn Youre worth the whole damn bunch put together Ive always been glad I said that It was the only compliment I ever gave him because I disapproved of him from beginning to end First he nodded politely and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile as if wed been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruptionand he had stood on those steps concealing his incorruptible dream as he waved them goodbye I thanked him for his hospitality We were always thanking him for thatI and the others Goodbye I called I enjoyed breakfast Gatsby  Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock then I fell asleep in my swivelchair Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead It was Jordan Baker she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golflinks had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry Ive left Daisys house she said Im at Hempstead and Im going down to Southampton this afternoon Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisys house but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid You werent so nice to me last night How could it have mattered then Silence for a moment Then HoweverI want to see you I want to see you too Suppose I dont go to Southampton and come into town this afternoon NoI dont think this afternoon Very well Its impossible this afternoon Various We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we werent talking any longer I dont know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I didnt care I couldnt have talked to her across a teatable that day if I never talked to her again in this world I called Gatsbys house a few minutes later but the line was busy I tried four times finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit Taking out my timetable I drew a small circle around the threefifty train Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think It was just noon  When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car I supposed thered be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilsons tragic achievement was forgotten Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before They had difficulty in locating the sister Catherine She must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing When they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sisters body Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside For a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it Finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door Michaelis and several other men were with him first four or five men later two or three men Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn About three oclock the quality of Wilsons incoherent muttering changedhe grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen But when he heard himself say this he flinched and began to cry Oh my God again in his groaning voice Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him How long have you been married George Come on there try and sit still a minute and answer my question How long have you been married Twelve years Ever had any children Come on George sit stillI asked you a question Did you ever have any children The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadnt stopped a few hours before He didnt like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the officehe knew every object in it before morningand from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet Have you got a church you go to sometimes George Maybe even if you havent been there for a long time Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you see Dont belong to any You ought to have a church George for times like this You must have gone to church once Didnt you get married in a church Listen George listen to me Didnt you get married in a church That was a long time ago The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rockingfor a moment he was silent Then the same halfknowing halfbewildered look came back into his faded eyes Look in the drawer there he said pointing at the desk Which drawer That drawerthat one Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand There was nothing in it but a small expensive dogleash made of leather and braided silver It was apparently new This he inquired holding it up Wilson stared and nodded I found it yesterday afternoon She tried to tell me about it but I knew it was something funny You mean your wife bought it She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau Michaelis didnt see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dogleash But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before from Myrtle because he began saying Oh my God again in a whisperhis comforter left several explanations in the air Then he killed her said Wilson His mouth dropped open suddenly Who did I have a way of finding out Youre morbid George said his friend This has been a strain to you and you dont know what youre saying Youd better try and sit quiet till morning He murdered her It was an accident George Wilson shook his head His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior Hm I know he said definitely Im one of these trusting fellas and I dont think any harm to nobody but when I get to know a thing I know it It was the man in that car She ran out to speak to him and he wouldnt stop Michaelis had seen this too but it hadnt occurred to him that there was any special significance in it He believed that Mrs Wilson had been running away from her husband rather than trying to stop any particular car How could she of been like that Shes a deep one said Wilson as if that answered the question Ahhh He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for George This was a forlorn hopehe was almost sure that Wilson had no friend there was not enough of him for his wife He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room a blue quickening by the window and realized that dawn wasnt far off About five oclock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light Wilsons glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind I spoke to her he muttered after a long silence I told her she might fool me but she couldnt fool God I took her to the windowwith an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against itand I said God knows what youve been doing everything youve been doing You may fool me but you cant fool God  Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night God sees everything repeated Wilson Thats an advertisement Michaelis assured him Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room But Wilson stood there a long time his face close to the window pane nodding into the twilight  By six oclock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone His movementshe was on foot all the timewere afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gads Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didnt eat and a cup of coffee He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didnt reach Gads Hill until noon Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his timethere were boys who had seen a man acting sort of crazy and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road Then for three hours he disappeared from view The police on the strength of what he said to Michaelis that he had a way of finding out supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout inquiring for a yellow car On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward and perhaps he had an easier surer way of finding out what he wanted to know By halfpast two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsbys house So by that time he knew Gatsbys name  At two oclock Gatsby put on his bathingsuit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up Then he gave instructions that the open car wasnt to be taken out under any circumstancesand this was strange because the front right fender needed repair Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool Once he stopped and shifted it a little and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four oclockuntil long after there was anyone to give it to if it came I have an idea that Gatsby himself didnt believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world paid a high price for living too long with a single dream He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass A new world material without being real where poor ghosts breathing dreams like air drifted fortuitously about  like that ashen fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees The chauffeurhe was one of Wolfshiems protgsheard the shotsafterwards he could only say that he hadnt thought anything much about them I drove from the station directly to Gatsbys house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone But they knew then I firmly believe With scarcely a word said four of us the chauffeur butler gardener and I hurried down to the pool There was a faint barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly tracing like the leg of transit a thin red circle in the water It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilsons body a little way off in the grass and the holocaust was complete IX After two years I remember the rest of that day and that night and the next day only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsbys front door A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered openmouthed about the pool Someone with a positive manner perhaps a detective used the expression madman as he bent over Wilsons body that afternoon and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning Most of those reports were a nightmaregrotesque circumstantial eager and untrue When Michaeliss testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilsons suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinadebut Catherine who might have said anything didnt say a word She showed a surprising amount of character about it toolooked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby that her sister was completely happy with her husband that her sister had been into no mischief whatever She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure So Wilson was reduced to a man deranged by grief in order that the case might remain in its simplest form And it rested there But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential I found myself on Gatsbys side and alone From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village every surmise about him and every practical question was referred to me At first I was surprised and confused then as he lay in his house and didnt move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible because no one else was interestedinterested I mean with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him called her instinctively and without hesitation But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon and taken baggage with them Left no address No Say when theyd be back No Any idea where they are How I could reach them I dont know Cant say I wanted to get somebody for him I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him Ill get somebody for you Gatsby Dont worry Just trust me and Ill get somebody for you Meyer Wolfshiems name wasnt in the phone book The butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called Information but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone Will you ring again Ive rung three times Its very important Sorry Im afraid no ones there I went back to the drawingroom and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors all these official people who suddenly filled it But though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes his protest continued in my brain Look here old sport youve got to get somebody for me Youve got to try hard I cant go through this alone Someone started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his deskhed never told me definitely that his parents were dead But there was nothingonly the picture of Dan Cody a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it I was sure hed start when he saw the newspapers just as I was sure thered be a wire from Daisy before noonbut neither a wire nor Mr Wolfshiem arrived no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men When the butler brought back Wolfshiems answer I began to have a feeling of defiance of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all Dear Mr Carraway This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out Yours truly Meyer Wolfshiem and then hasty addenda beneath Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last But the connection came through as a mans voice very thin and far away This is Slagle speaking  Yes The name was unfamiliar Hell of a note isnt it Get my wire There havent been any wires Young Parkes in trouble he said rapidly They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter They got a circular from New York giving em the numbers just five minutes before What dyou know about that hey You never can tell in these hick towns Hello I interrupted breathlessly Look herethis isnt Mr Gatsby Mr Gatsbys dead There was a long silence on the other end of the wire followed by an exclamation  then a quick squawk as the connection was broken  I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came It was Gatsbys father a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat He was on the point of collapse so I took him into the musicroom and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat But he wouldnt eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand I saw it in the Chicago newspaper he said It was all in the Chicago newspaper I started right away I didnt know how to reach you His eyes seeing nothing moved ceaselessly about the room It was a madman he said He must have been mad Wouldnt you like some coffee I urged him I dont want anything Im all right now Mr Carraway Well Im all right now Where have they got Jimmy I took him into the drawingroom where his son lay and left him there Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall when I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away After a little while Mr Gatz opened the door and came out his mouth ajar his face flushed slightly his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride I helped him to a bedroom upstairs while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came I didnt know what youd want Mr Gatsby Gatz is my name Mr Gatz I thought you might want to take the body West He shook his head Jimmy always liked it better down East He rose up to his position in the East Were you a friend of my boys Mr We were close friends He had a big future before him you know He was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here He touched his head impressively and I nodded If hed of lived hed of been a great man A man like James J Hill Hed of helped build up the country Thats true I said uncomfortably He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet trying to take it from the bed and lay down stifflywas instantly asleep That night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name This is Mr Carraway I said Oh He sounded relieved This is Klipspringer I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsbys grave I didnt want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so Id been calling up a few people myself They were hard to find The funerals tomorrow I said Three oclock here at the house I wish youd tell anybody whod be interested Oh I will he broke out hastily Of course Im not likely to see anybody but if I do His tone made me suspicious Of course youll be there yourself Well Ill certainly try What I called up about is Wait a minute I interrupted How about saying youll come Well the fact isthe truth of the matter is that Im staying with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow In fact theres a sort of picnic or something Of course Ill do my best to get away I ejaculated an unrestrained Huh and he must have heard me for he went on nervously What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there I wonder if itd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on You see theyre tennis shoes and Im sort of helpless without them My address is care of B F I didnt hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsbyone gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved However that was my fault for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsbys liquor and I should have known better than to call him The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem I couldnt seem to reach him any other way The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked The Swastika Holding Company and at first there didnt seem to be anyone inside But when Id shouted hello several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes Nobodys in she said Mr Wolfshiems gone to Chicago The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle The Rosary tunelessly inside Please say that Mr Carraway wants to see him I cant get him back from Chicago can I At this moment a voice unmistakably Wolfshiems called Stella from the other side of the door Leave your name on the desk she said quickly Ill give it to him when he gets back But I know hes there She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips You young men think you can force your way in here any time she scolded Were getting sickantired of it When I say hes in Chicago hes in Chicago I mentioned Gatsby Ohh She looked at me over again Will you justWhat was your name She vanished In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway holding out both hands He drew me into his office remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us and offered me a cigar My memory goes back to when first I met him he said A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldnt buy some regular clothes First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenners poolroom at Fortythird Street and asked for a job He hadnt eat anything for a couple of days Come on have some lunch with me I said He ate more than four dollars worth of food in half an hour Did you start him in business I inquired Start him I made him Oh I raised him up out of nothing right out of the gutter I saw right away he was a fineappearing gentlemanly young man and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany We were so thick like that in everythinghe held up two bulbous fingersalways together I wondered if this partnership had included the Worlds Series transaction in  Now hes dead I said after a moment You were his closest friend so I know youll want to come to his funeral this afternoon Id like to come Well come then The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears I cant do itI cant get mixed up in it he said Theres nothing to get mixed up in Its all over now When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way I keep out When I was a young man it was differentif a friend of mine died no matter how I stuck with them to the end You may think thats sentimental but I mean itto the bitter end I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come so I stood up Are you a college man he inquired suddenly For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a gonnegtion but he only nodded and shook my hand Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead he suggested After that my own rule is to let everything alone When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall His pride in his son and in his sons possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me Jimmy sent me this picture He took out his wallet with trembling fingers Look there It was a photograph of the house cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands He pointed out every detail to me eagerly Look there and then sought admiration from my eyes He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself Jimmy sent it to me I think its a very pretty picture It shows up well Very well Had you seen him lately He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now there was a reason for it He knew he had a big future in front of him And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me He seemed reluctant to put away the picture held it for another minute lingeringly before my eyes Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy Look here this is a book he had when he was a boy It just shows you He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see On the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule and the date September   And underneath Rise from bed  am Dumbell exercise and wallscaling   Study electricity etc   Work  pm Baseball and sports   Practise elocution poise and how to attain it   Study needed inventions   General Resolves  No wasting time at Shafters or a name indecipherable  No more smokeing or chewing  Bath every other day  Read one improving book or magazine per week  Save  crossed out  per week  Be better to parents I came across this book by accident said the old man It just shows you dont it It just shows you Jimmy was bound to get ahead He always had some resolves like this or something Do you notice what hes got about improving his mind He was always great for that He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it He was reluctant to close the book reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars So did Gatsbys father And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way The minister glanced several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour But it wasnt any use Nobody came  About five oclock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gatefirst a motor hearse horribly black and wet then Mr Gatz and the minister and me in the limousine and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsbys station wagon all wet to the skin As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground I looked around It was the man with owleyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsbys books in the library one night three months before Id never seen him since then I dont know how he knew about the funeral or even his name The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsbys grave I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember without resentment that Daisy hadnt sent a message or a flower Dimly I heard someone murmur Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on and then the owleyed man said Amen to that in a brave voice We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars Owleyes spoke to me by the gate I couldnt get to the house he remarked Neither could anybody else Go on He started Why my God they used to go there by the hundreds He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in The poor sonofabitch he said  One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six oclock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gaieties to bid them a hasty goodbye I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss ThisorThats and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations Are you going to the Ordways the Herseys the Schultzes and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago Milwaukee and St Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow our snow began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again Thats my Middle Westnot the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow I am part of that a little solemn with the feel of those long winters a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a familys name I see now that this has been a story of the West after allTom and Gatsby Daisy and Jordan and I were all Westerners and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life Even when the East excited me most even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored sprawling swollen towns beyond the Ohio with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very oldeven then it had always for me a quality of distortion West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams I see it as a night scene by El Greco a hundred houses at once conventional and grotesque crouching under a sullen overhanging sky and a lustreless moon In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress Her hand which dangles over the side sparkles cold with jewels Gravely the men turn in at a housethe wrong house But no one knows the womans name and no one cares After Gatsbys death the East was haunted for me like that distorted beyond my eyes power of correction So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home There was one thing to be done before I left an awkward unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration her chin raised a little jauntily her hair the colour of an autumn leaf her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised For just a minute I wondered if I wasnt making a mistake then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye Nevertheless you did throw me over said Jordan suddenly You threw me over on the telephone I dont give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while We shook hands Oh and do you remembershe addeda conversation we had once about driving a car Whynot exactly You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver Well I met another bad driver didnt I I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess I thought you were rather an honest straightforward person I thought it was your secret pride Im thirty I said Im five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour She didnt answer Angry and half in love with her and tremendously sorry I turned away  One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert aggressive way his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference his head moving sharply here and there adapting itself to his restless eyes Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand Whats the matter Nick Do you object to shaking hands with me Yes You know what I think of you Youre crazy Nick he said quickly Crazy as hell I dont know whats the matter with you Tom I inquired what did you say to Wilson that afternoon He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm I told him the truth he said He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we werent in he tried to force his way upstairs He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadnt told him who owned the car His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house He broke off defiantly What if I did tell him That fellow had it coming to him He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisys but he was a tough one He ran over Myrtle like youd run over a dog and never even stopped his car There was nothing I could say except the one unutterable fact that it wasnt true And if you think I didnt have my share of sufferinglook here when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby By God it was awful I couldnt forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was to him entirely justified It was all very careless and confused They were careless people Tom and Daisythey smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made  I shook hands with him it seemed silly not to for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklaceor perhaps only a pair of cuff buttonsrid of my provincial squeamishness forever  Gatsbys house was still empty when I leftthe grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own I didnt want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps But I didnt investigate Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didnt know that the party was over On the last night with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more On the white steps an obscene word scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors eyesa fresh green breast of the new world Its vanished trees the trees that had made way for Gatsbys house had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder And as I sat there brooding on the old unknown world I thought of Gatsbys wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisys dock He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it He did not know that it was already behind him somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night Gatsby believed in the green light the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us It eluded us then but thats no mattertomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms further  And one fine morning So we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past  END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG

            "[' START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK   The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald Table of Contents I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX Once again to Zelda Then wear the gold hat if that will move her If you can bounce high bounce for her too Till she cry Lover goldhatted highbouncing lover I must have you Thomas Parke dInvilliers I In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind ever since Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had He didnt say any more but weve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that In consequence Im inclined to reserve all judgements a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild unknown men Most of the confidences were unsoughtfrequently I have feigned sleep preoccupation or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that as my father snobbishly suggested and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth And after boasting this way of my tolerance I come to the admission that it has a limit Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I dont care what its founded on When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart Only Gatsby the man who gives his name to this book was exempt from my reactionGatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures then there was something gorgeous about him some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperamentit was an extraordinary gift for hope a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again NoGatsby turned out all right at the end it is what preyed on Gatsby what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and shortwinded elations of men  My family have been prominent welltodo people in this Middle Western city for three generations The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that were descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch but the actual founder of my line was my grandfathers brother who came here in fiftyone sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today I never saw this greatuncle but Im supposed to look like himwith special reference to the rather hardboiled painting that hangs in fathers office I graduated from New Haven in  just a quarter of a century after my father and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War I enjoyed the counterraid so thoroughly that I came back restless Instead of being the warm centre of the world the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universeso I decided to go East and learn the bond business Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me and finally said Whyyees with very grave hesitant faces Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came East permanently I thought in the spring of twentytwo The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea He found the house a weatherbeaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone I had a dogat least I had him for a few days until he ran awayand an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man more recently arrived than I stopped me on the road How do you get to West Egg village he asked helplessly I told him And as I walked on I was lonely no longer I was a guide a pathfinder an original settler He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breathgiving air I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides I was rather literary in collegeone year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale Newsand now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists the wellrounded man This isnt just an epigramlife is much more successfully looked at from a single window after all It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New Yorkand where there are among other natural curiosities two unusual formations of land Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound They are not perfect ovalslike the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact endbut their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size I lived at West Egg thewell the less fashionable of the two though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them My house was at the very tip of the egg only fifty yards from the Sound and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standardit was a factual imitation of some Htel de Ville in Normandy with a tower on one side spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden It was Gatsbys mansion Or rather as I didnt know Mr Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name My own house was an eyesore but it was a small eyesore and it had been overlooked so I had a view of the water a partial view of my neighbours lawn and the consoling proximity of millionairesall for eighty dollars a month Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans Daisy was my second cousin once removed and Id known Tom in college And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago Her husband among various physical accomplishments had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Havena national figure in a way one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twentyone that everything afterward savours of anticlimax His family were enormously wealthyeven in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproachbut now hed left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away for instance hed brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that Why they came East I dont know They had spent a year in France for no particular reason and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together This was a permanent move said Daisy over the telephone but I didnt believe itI had no sight into Daisys heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all Their house was even more elaborate than I expected a cheerful redandwhite Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardensfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run The front was broken by a line of French windows glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch He had changed since his New Haven years Now he was a sturdy strawhaired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyhe seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat It was a body capable of enormous leveragea cruel body His speaking voice a gruff husky tenor added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed There was a touch of paternal contempt in it even toward people he likedand there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts Now dont think my opinion on these matters is final he seemed to say just because Im stronger and more of a man than you are We were in the same senior society and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh defiant wistfulness of his own We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch Ive got a nice place here he said his eyes flashing about restlessly Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snubnosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore It belonged to Demaine the oil man He turned me around again politely and abruptly Well go inside We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosycoloured space fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house A breeze blew through the room blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags twisting them up toward the frosted weddingcake of the ceiling and then rippled over the winecoloured rug making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor The younger of the two was a stranger to me She was extended full length at her end of the divan completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of itindeed I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in The other girl Daisy made an attempt to riseshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expressionthen she laughed an absurd charming little laugh and I laughed too and came forward into the room Im pparalysed with happiness She laughed again as if she said something very witty and held my hand for a moment looking up into my face promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see That was a way she had She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker Ive heard it said that Daisys murmur was only to make people lean toward her an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming At any rate Miss Bakers lips fluttered she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back againthe object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright Again a sort of apology arose to my lips Almost any exhibition of complete selfsufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low thrilling voice It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget a singing compulsion a whispered Listen a promise that she had done gay exciting things just a while since and that there were gay exciting things hovering in the next hour I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East and how a dozen people had sent their love through me Do they miss me she cried ecstatically The whole town is desolate All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and theres a persistent wail all night along the north shore How gorgeous Lets go back Tom Tomorrow Then she added irrelevantly You ought to see the baby Id like to Shes asleep Shes three years old Havent you ever seen her Never Well you ought to see her Shes Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder What you doing Nick Im a bond man Who with I told him Never heard of them he remarked decisively This annoyed me You will I answered shortly You will if you stay in the East Oh Ill stay in the East dont you worry he said glancing at Daisy and then back at me as if he were alert for something more Id be a God damned fool to live anywhere else At this point Miss Baker said Absolutely with such suddenness that I startedit was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me for she yawned and with a series of rapid deft movements stood up into the room Im stiff she complained Ive been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember Dont look at me Daisy retorted Ive been trying to get you to New York all afternoon No thanks said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry Im absolutely in training Her host looked at her incredulously You are He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass How you ever get anything done is beyond me I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she got done I enjoyed looking at her She was a slender smallbreasted girl with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet Her grey sunstrained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan charming discontented face It occurred to me now that I had seen her or a picture of her somewhere before You live in West Egg she remarked contemptuously I know somebody there I dont know a single You must know Gatsby Gatsby demanded Daisy What Gatsby Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square Slenderly languidly their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out on to a rosycoloured porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind Why candles objected Daisy frowning She snapped them out with her fingers In two weeks itll be the longest day in the year She looked at us all radiantly Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it We ought to plan something yawned Miss Baker sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed All right said Daisy Whatll we plan She turned to me helplessly What do people plan Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger Look she complained I hurt it We all lookedthe knuckle was black and blue You did it Tom she said accusingly I know you didnt mean to but you did do it Thats what I get for marrying a brute of a man a great big hulking physical specimen of a I hate that word hulking  objected Tom crossly even in kidding Hulking insisted Daisy Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire They were here and they accepted Tom and me making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself You make me feel uncivilized Daisy I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret Cant you talk about crops or something I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way Civilizations going to pieces broke out Tom violently Ive gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard Why no I answered rather surprised by his tone Well its a fine book and everybody ought to read it The idea is if we dont look out the white race will bewill be utterly submerged Its all scientific stuff its been proved Toms getting very profound said Daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness He reads deep books with long words in them What was that word we Well these books are all scientific insisted Tom glancing at her impatiently This fellow has worked out the whole thing Its up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things Weve got to beat them down whispered Daisy winking ferociously toward the fervent sun You ought to live in California began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair This idea is that were Nordics I am and you are and you are and After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again And weve produced all the things that go to make civilizationoh science and art and all that Do you see There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency more acute than of old was not enough to him any more When almost immediately the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me Ill tell you a family secret she whispered enthusiastically Its about the butlers nose Do you want to hear about the butlers nose Thats why I came over tonight Well he wasnt always a butler he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose Things went from bad to worse suggested Miss Baker Yes Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listenedthen the glow faded each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk The butler came back and murmured something close to Toms ear whereupon Tom frowned pushed back his chair and without a word went inside As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again her voice glowing and singing I love to see you at my table Nick You remind me of aof a rose an absolute rose Doesnt he She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation An absolute rose This was untrue I am not even faintly like a rose She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless thrilling words Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said Sh in a warning voice A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed trying to hear The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence sank down mounted excitedly and then ceased altogether This Mr Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour I began Dont talk I want to hear what happens Is something happening I inquired innocently You mean to say you dont know said Miss Baker honestly surprised I thought everybody knew I dont Why she said hesitantly Toms got some woman in New York Got some woman I repeated blankly Miss Baker nodded She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time Dont you think Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table It couldnt be helped cried Daisy with tense gaiety She sat down glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued I looked outdoors for a minute and its very romantic outdoors Theres a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line Hes singing away Her voice sang Its romantic isnt it Tom Very romantic he said and then miserably to me If its light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables The telephone rang inside startlingly and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables in fact all subjects vanished into air Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again pointlessly and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone and yet to avoid all eyes I couldnt guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill metallic urgency out of mind To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguingmy own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police The horses needless to say were not mentioned again Tom and Miss Baker with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl We dont know each other very well Nick she said suddenly Even if we are cousins You didnt come to my wedding I wasnt back from the war Thats true She hesitated Well Ive had a very bad time Nick and Im pretty cynical about everything Evidently she had reason to be I waited but she didnt say any more and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter I suppose she talks andeats and everything Oh yes She looked at me absently Listen Nick let me tell you what I said when she was born Would you like to hear Very much Itll show you how Ive gotten to feel aboutthings Well she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl She told me it was a girl and so I turned my head away and wept All right I said Im glad its a girl And I hope shell be a foolthats the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful little fool You see I think everythings terrible anyhow she went on in a convinced way Everybody thinks sothe most advanced people And I know Ive been everywhere and seen everything and done everything Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way rather like Toms and she laughed with thrilling scorn SophisticatedGod Im sophisticated The instant her voice broke off ceasing to compel my attention my belief I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said It made me uneasy as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me I waited and sure enough in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged  Inside the crimson room bloomed with light Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Postthe words murmurous and uninflected running together in a soothing tune The lamplight bright on his boots and dull on the autumnleaf yellow of her hair glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand To be continued she said tossing the magazine on the table in our very next issue Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee and she stood up Ten oclock she remarked apparently finding the time on the ceiling Time for this good girl to go to bed Jordans going to play in the tournament tomorrow explained Daisy over at Westchester Ohyoure Jordan Baker I knew now why her face was familiarits pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach I had heard some story of her too a critical unpleasant story but what it was I had forgotten long ago Good night she said softly Wake me at eight wont you If youll get up I will Good night Mr Carraway See you anon Of course you will confirmed Daisy In fact I think Ill arrange a marriage Come over often Nick and Ill sort ofohfling you together You knowlock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat and all that sort of thing Good night called Miss Baker from the stairs I havent heard a word Shes a nice girl said Tom after a moment They oughtnt to let her run around the country this way Who oughtnt to inquired Daisy coldly Her family Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old Besides Nicks going to look after her arent you Nick Shes going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer I think the home influence will be very good for her Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence Is she from New York I asked quickly From Louisville Our white girlhood was passed together there Our beautiful white Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda demanded Tom suddenly Did I She looked at me I cant seem to remember but I think we talked about the Nordic race Yes Im sure we did It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know Dont believe everything you hear Nick he advised me I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all and a few minutes later I got up to go home They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called Wait I forgot to ask you something and its important We heard you were engaged to a girl out West Thats right corroborated Tom kindly We heard that you were engaged Its a libel Im too poor But we heard it insisted Daisy surprising me by opening up again in a flowerlike way We heard it from three people so it must be true Of course I knew what they were referring to but I wasnt even vaguely engaged The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East You cant stop going with an old friend on account of rumours and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely richnevertheless I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house child in armsbut apparently there were no such intentions in her head As for Tom the fact that he had some woman in New York was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages where new red petrolpumps sat out in pools of light and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard The wind had blown off leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alonefifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbours mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr Gatsby himself come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens I decided to call to him Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner and that would do for an introduction But I didnt call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alonehe stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling Involuntarily I glanced seawardand distinguished nothing except a single green light minute and far away that might have been the end of a dock When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness II About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land This is a valley of ashesa fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally with a transcendent effort of ashgrey men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest and immediately the ashgrey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it you perceive after a moment the eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg The eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg are blue and gigantictheir retinas are one yard high They look out of no face but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away But his eyes dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain brood on over the solemn dumping ground The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanans mistress The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafs with her and leaving her at a table sauntered about chatting with whomsoever he knew Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet herbut I did I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car Were getting off he insisted I want you to meet my girl I think hed tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburgs persistent stare The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an allnight restaurant approached by a trail of ashes the third was a garageRepairs George B Wilson Cars bought and soldand I followed Tom inside The interior was unprosperous and bare the only car visible was the dustcovered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office wiping his hands on a piece of waste He was a blond spiritless man anaemic and faintly handsome When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes Hello Wilson old man said Tom slapping him jovially on the shoulder Hows business I cant complain answered Wilson unconvincingly When are you going to sell me that car Next week Ive got my man working on it now Works pretty slow dont he No he doesnt said Tom coldly And if you feel that way about it maybe Id better sell it somewhere else after all I dont mean that explained Wilson quickly I just meant His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door She was in the middle thirties and faintly stout but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can Her face above a spotted dress of dark blue crpedechine contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom looking him flush in the eye Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft coarse voice Get some chairs why dont you so somebody can sit down Oh sure agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinityexcept his wife who moved close to Tom I want to see you said Tom intently Get on the next train All right Ill meet you by the newsstand on the lower level She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door We waited for her down the road and out of sight It was a few days before the Fourth of July and a grey scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track Terrible place isnt it said Tom exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg Awful It does her good to get away Doesnt her husband object Wilson He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York Hes so dumb he doesnt know hes alive So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New Yorkor not quite together for Mrs Wilson sat discreetly in another car Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a movingpicture magazine and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume Upstairs in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one lavendercoloured with grey upholstery and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass I want to get one of those dogs she said earnestly I want to get one for the apartment Theyre nice to havea dog We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D Rockefeller In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed What kind are they asked Mrs Wilson eagerly as he came to the taxiwindow All kinds What kind do you want lady Id like to get one of those police dogs I dont suppose you got that kind The man peered doubtfully into the basket plunged in his hand and drew one up wriggling by the back of the neck Thats no police dog said Tom No its not exactly a police dog said the man with disappointment in his voice Its more of an Airedale He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back Look at that coat Some coat Thats a dog thatll never bother you with catching cold I think its cute said Mrs Wilson enthusiastically How much is it That dog He looked at it admiringly That dog will cost you ten dollars The Airedaleundoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly whitechanged hands and settled down into Mrs Wilsons lap where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture Is it a boy or a girl she asked delicately That dog That dogs a boy Its a bitch said Tom decisively Heres your money Go and buy ten more dogs with it We drove over to Fifth Avenue warm and soft almost pastoral on the summer Sunday afternoon I wouldnt have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner Hold on I said I have to leave you here No you dont interposed Tom quickly Myrtlell be hurt if you dont come up to the apartment Wont you Myrtle Come on she urged Ill telephone my sister Catherine Shes said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know Well Id like to but We went on cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds At th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartmenthouses Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood Mrs Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in Im going to have the McKees come up she announced as we rose in the elevator And of course I got to call up my sister too The apartment was on the top floora small livingroom a small diningroom a small bedroom and a bath The livingroom was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles The only picture was an overenlarged photograph apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway Mrs Wilson was first concerned with the dog A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuitsone of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight oclock the apartment was full of cheerful sun Sitting on Toms lap Mrs Wilson called up several people on the telephone then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner When I came back they had both disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the livingroom and read a chapter of Simon Called Petereither it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things because it didnt make any sense to me Just as Tom and Myrtle after the first drink Mrs Wilson and I called each other by our first names reappeared company commenced to arrive at the apartment door The sister Catherine was a slender worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here But when I asked her she laughed immoderately repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel Mr McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room He informed me that he was in the artistic game and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs Wilsons mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall His wife was shrill languid handsome and horrible She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twentyseven times since they had been married Mrs Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of creamcoloured chiffon which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur Her laughter her gestures her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy creaking pivot through the smoky air My dear she told her sister in a high mincing shout most of these fellas will cheat you every time All they think of is money I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill youd of thought she had my appendicitis out What was the name of the woman asked Mrs McKee Mrs Eberhardt She goes around looking at peoples feet in their own homes I like your dress remarked Mrs McKee I think its adorable Mrs Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain Its just a crazy old thing she said I just slip it on sometimes when I dont care what I look like But it looks wonderful on you if you know what I mean pursued Mrs McKee If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it We all looked in silence at Mrs Wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile Mr McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face I should change the light he said after a moment Id like to bring out the modelling of the features And Id try to get hold of all the back hair I wouldnt think of changing the light cried Mrs McKee I think its Her husband said Sh and we all looked at the subject again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet You McKees have something to drink he said Get some more ice and mineral water Myrtle before everybody goes to sleep I told that boy about the ice Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders These people You have to keep after them all the time She looked at me and laughed pointlessly Then she flounced over to the dog kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there Ive done some nice things out on Long Island asserted Mr McKee Tom looked at him blankly Two of them we have framed downstairs Two what demanded Tom Two studies One of them I call Montauk PointThe Gulls and the other I call Montauk PointThe Sea The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch Do you live down on Long Island too she inquired I live at West Egg Really I was down there at a party about a month ago At a man named Gatsbys Do you know him I live next door to him Well they say hes a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelms Thats where all his money comes from Really She nodded Im scared of him Id hate to have him get anything on me This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs McKees pointing suddenly at Catherine Chester I think you could do something with her she broke out but Mr McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to Tom Id like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry All I ask is that they should give me a start Ask Myrtle said Tom breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs Wilson entered with a tray Shell give you a letter of introduction wont you Myrtle Do what she asked startled Youll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband so he can do some studies of him His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented  George B Wilson at the Gasoline Pump or something like that Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear Neither of them can stand the person theyre married to Cant they Cant stand them She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom What I say is why go on living with them if they cant stand them If I was them Id get a divorce and get married to each other right away Doesnt she like Wilson either The answer to this was unexpected It came from Myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene You see cried Catherine triumphantly She lowered her voice again Its really his wife thats keeping them apart Shes a Catholic and they dont believe in divorce Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie When they do get married continued Catherine theyre going West to live for a while until it blows over Itd be more discreet to go to Europe Oh do you like Europe she exclaimed surprisingly I just got back from Monte Carlo Really Just last year I went over there with another girl Stay long No we just went to Monte Carlo and back We went by way of Marseilles We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms We had an awful time getting back I can tell you God how I hated that town The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterraneanthen the shrill voice of Mrs McKee called me back into the room I almost made a mistake too she declared vigorously I almost married a little kike whod been after me for years I knew he was below me Everybody kept saying to me Lucille that mans way below you But if I hadnt met Chester hed of got me sure Yes but listen said Myrtle Wilson nodding her head up and down at least you didnt marry him I know I didnt Well I married him said Myrtle ambiguously And thats the difference between your case and mine Why did you Myrtle demanded Catherine Nobody forced you to Myrtle considered I married him because I thought he was a gentleman she said finally I thought he knew something about breeding but he wasnt fit to lick my shoe You were crazy about him for a while said Catherine Crazy about him cried Myrtle incredulously Who said I was crazy about him I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there She pointed suddenly at me and everyone looked at me accusingly I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection The only crazy I was was when I married him I knew right away I made a mistake He borrowed somebodys best suit to get married in and never even told me about it and the man came after it one day when he was out Oh is that your suit I said This is the first I ever heard about it But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon She really ought to get away from him resumed Catherine to me Theyve been living over that garage for eleven years And Toms the first sweetie she ever had The bottle of whiskya second onewas now in constant demand by all present excepting Catherine who felt just as good on nothing at all Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches which were a complete supper in themselves I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back as if with ropes into my chair Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets and I saw him too looking up and wondering I was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and I couldnt keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head When we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm and so I told him Id have to call a policeman but he knew I lied I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didnt hardly know I wasnt getting into a subway train All I kept thinking about over and over was You cant live forever you cant live forever  She turned to Mrs McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter My dear she cried Im going to give you this dress as soon as Im through with it Ive got to get another one tomorrow Im going to make a list of all the things Ive got to get A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring and a wreath with a black silk bow for mothers grave thatll last all summer I got to write down a list so I wont forget all the things I got to do It was nine oclockalmost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten Mr McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap like a photograph of a man of action Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly People disappeared reappeared made plans to go somewhere and then lost each other searched for each other found each other a few feet away Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs Wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs Wilson had any right to mention Daisys name Daisy Daisy Daisy shouted Mrs Wilson Ill say it whenever I want to Daisy Dai Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor and womens voices scolding and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain Mr McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scenehis wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles Then Mr McKee turned and continued on out the door Taking my hat from the chandelier I followed Come to lunch some day he suggested as we groaned down in the elevator Where Anywhere Keep your hands off the lever snapped the elevator boy I beg your pardon said Mr McKee with dignity I didnt know I was touching it All right I agreed Ill be glad to  I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets clad in his underwear with a great portfolio in his hands Beauty and the Beast  Loneliness  Old Grocery Horse  Brookn Bridge  Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station staring at the morning Tribune and waiting for the four oclock train III There was music from my neighbours house through the summer nights In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the Sound drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam On weekends his RollsRoyce became an omnibus bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbingbrushes and hammers and gardenshears repairing the ravages of the night before Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New Yorkevery Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butlers thumb At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsbys enormous garden On buffet tables garnished with glistening horsdoeuvre spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another By seven oclock the orchestra has arrived no thin fivepiece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours and hair bobbed in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each others names The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher Laughter is easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tipped out at a cheerful word The groups change more swiftly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable become for a sharp joyous moment the centre of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the seachange of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal seizes a cocktail out of the air dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform A momentary hush the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Grays understudy from the Follies The party has begun I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsbys house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited People were not invitedthey went there They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsbys door Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission I had been actually invited A chauffeur in a uniform of robinsegg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer the honour would be entirely Gatsbys it said if I would attend his little party that night He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented itsigned Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didnt knowthough here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about all well dressed all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans I was sure that they were selling something bonds or insurance or automobiles They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail tablethe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden Welcome or not I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby Hello I roared advancing toward her My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden I thought you might be here she responded absently as I came up I remembered you lived next door to She held my hand impersonally as a promise that shed take care of me in a minute and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps Hello they cried together Sorry you didnt win That was for the golf tournament She had lost in the finals the week before You dont know who we are said one of the girls in yellow but we met you here about a month ago Youve dyed your hair since then remarked Jordan and I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon produced like the supper no doubt out of a caterers basket With Jordans slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men each one introduced to us as Mr Mumble Do you come to these parties often inquired Jordan of the girl beside her The last one was the one I met you at answered the girl in an alert confident voice She turned to her companion Wasnt it for you Lucille It was for Lucille too I like to come Lucille said I never care what I do so I always have a good time When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair and he asked me my name and addressinside of a week I got a package from Croiriers with a new evening gown in it Did you keep it asked Jordan Sure I did I was going to wear it tonight but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered It was gas blue with lavender beads Two hundred and sixtyfive dollars Theres something funny about a fellow thatll do a thing like that said the other girl eagerly He doesnt want any trouble with anybody Who doesnt I inquired Gatsby Somebody told me The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once A thrill passed over all of us The three Mr Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly I dont think its so much that argued Lucille sceptically Its more that he was a German spy during the war One of the men nodded in confirmation I heard that from a man who knew all about him grew up with him in Germany he assured us positively Oh no said the first girl it couldnt be that because he was in the American army during the war As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodys looking at him Ill bet he killed a man She narrowed her eyes and shivered Lucille shivered We all turned and looked around for Gatsby It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world The first supperthere would be another one after midnightwas now being served and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden There were three married couples and Jordans escort a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countrysideEast Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety Lets get out whispered Jordan after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate halfhour this is much too polite for me We got up and she explained that we were going to find the host I had never met him she said and it was making me uneasy The undergraduate nodded in a cynical melancholy way The bar where we glanced first was crowded but Gatsby was not there She couldnt find him from the top of the steps and he wasnt on the veranda On a chance we tried an importantlooking door and walked into a high Gothic library panelled with carved English oak and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas A stout middleaged man with enormous owleyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot What do you think he demanded impetuously About what He waved his hand toward the bookshelves About that As a matter of fact you neednt bother to ascertain I ascertained Theyre real The books He nodded Absolutely realhave pages and everything I thought theyd be a nice durable cardboard Matter of fact theyre absolutely real Pages andHere Lemme show you Taking our scepticism for granted he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures See he cried triumphantly Its a bonafide piece of printed matter It fooled me This fellas a regular Belasco Its a triumph What thoroughness What realism Knew when to stop toodidnt cut the pages But what do you want What do you expect He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse Who brought you he demanded Or did you just come I was brought Most people were brought Jordan looked at him alertly cheerfully without answering I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt he continued Mrs Claud Roosevelt Do you know her I met her somewhere last night Ive been drunk for about a week now and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library Has it A little bit I think I cant tell yet Ive only been here an hour Did I tell you about the books Theyre real Theyre You told us We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles superior couples holding each other tortuously fashionably and keeping in the cornersand a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps By midnight the hilarity had increased A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky A pair of stage twins who turned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than fingerbowls The moon had risen higher and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales trembling a little to the stiff tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn I was still with Jordan Baker We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter I was enjoying myself now I had taken two fingerbowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant elemental and profound At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled Your face is familiar he said politely Werent you in the First Division during the war Why yes I was in the Twentyeighth Infantry I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteeneighteen I knew Id seen you somewhere before We talked for a moment about some wet grey little villages in France Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning Want to go with me old sport Just near the shore along the Sound What time Any time that suits you best It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled Having a gay time now she inquired Much better I turned again to my new acquaintance This is an unusual party for me I havent even seen the host I live over there I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand Im Gatsby he said suddenly What I exclaimed Oh I beg your pardon I thought you knew old sport Im afraid Im not a very good host He smiled understandinglymuch more than understandingly It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life It facedor seemed to facethe whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that at your best you hoped to convey Precisely at that point it vanishedand I was looking at an elegant young roughneck a year or two over thirty whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd Some time before he introduced himself Id got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care Almost at the moment when Mr Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn If you want anything just ask for it old sport he urged me Excuse me I will rejoin you later When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordanconstrained to assure her of my surprise I had expected that Mr Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years Who is he I demanded Do you know Hes just a man named Gatsby Where is he from I mean And what does he do Now youre started on the subject she answered with a wan smile Well he told me once he was an Oxford man A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away However I dont believe it Why not I dont know she insisted I just dont think he went there Something in her tone reminded me of the other girls I think he killed a man and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York That was comprehensible But young men didntat least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didntdrift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound Anyhow he gives large parties said Jordan changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete And I like large parties Theyre so intimate At small parties there isnt any privacy There was the boom of a bass drum and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden Ladies and gentlemen he cried At the request of Mr Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr Vladmir Tostoffs latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation He smiled with jovial condescension and added Some sensation Whereupon everybody laughed The piece is known he concluded lustily as Vladmir Tostoffs Jazz History of the World  The nature of Mr Tostoffs composition eluded me because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day I could see nothing sinister about him I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased When the Jazz History of the World was over girls were putting their heads on mens shoulders in a puppyish convivial way girls were swooning backward playfully into mens arms even into groups knowing that someone would arrest their fallsbut no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsbys shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsbys head for one link I beg your pardon Gatsbys butler was suddenly standing beside us Miss Baker he inquired I beg your pardon but Mr Gatsby would like to speak to you alone With me she exclaimed in surprise Yes madame She got up slowly raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment and followed the butler toward the house I noticed that she wore her eveningdress all her dresses like sports clothesthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean crisp mornings I was alone and it was almost two For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long manywindowed room which overhung the terrace Eluding Jordans undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls and who implored me to join him I went inside The large room was full of people One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall redhaired young lady from a famous chorus engaged in song She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sadshe was not only singing she was weeping too Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano The tears coursed down her cheeksnot freely however for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep She had a fight with a man who says hes her husband explained a girl at my elbow I looked around Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands Even Jordans party the quartet from East Egg were rent asunder by dissension One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacksat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond and hissed You promised into his ear The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices Whenever he sees Im having a good time he wants to go home Never heard anything so selfish in my life Were always the first ones to leave So are we Well were almost the last tonight said one of the men sheepishly The orchestra left half an hour ago In spite of the wives agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short struggle and both wives were lifted kicking into the night As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye Jordans party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands Ive just heard the most amazing thing she whispered How long were we in there Why about an hour It was  simply amazing she repeated abstractedly But I swore I wouldnt tell it and here I am tantalizing you She yawned gracefully in my face Please come and see me  Phone book  Under the name of Mrs Sigourney Howard  My aunt  She was hurrying off as she talkedher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late I joined the last of Gatsbys guests who were clustered around him I wanted to explain that Id hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden Dont mention it he enjoined me eagerly Dont give it another thought old sport The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder And dont forget were going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine oclock Then the butler behind his shoulder Philadelphia wants you on the phone sir All right in a minute Tell them Ill be right there  Good night Good night Good night He smiledand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go as if he had desired it all the time Good night old sport  Good night But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene In the ditch beside the road right side up but violently shorn of one wheel rested a new coup which had left Gatsbys drive not two minutes before The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs However as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant puzzled way See he explained It went in the ditch The fact was infinitely astonishing to him and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the manit was the late patron of Gatsbys library Howd it happen He shrugged his shoulders I know nothing whatever about mechanics he said decisively But how did it happen Did you run into the wall Dont ask me said Owl Eyes washing his hands of the whole matter I know very little about drivingnext to nothing It happened and thats all I know Well if youre a poor driver you oughtnt to try driving at night But I wasnt even trying he explained indignantly I wasnt even trying An awed hush fell upon the bystanders Do you want to commit suicide Youre lucky it was just a wheel A bad driver and not even trying You dont understand explained the criminal I wasnt driving Theres another man in the car The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained Ahhh as the door of the coup swung slowly open The crowdit was now a crowdstepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause Then very gradually part by part a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster Whas matter he inquired calmly Did we run outa gas Look Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheelhe stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky It came off someone explained He nodded At first I din notice wed stopped A pause Then taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice Wonderff tell me where theres a gasline station At least a dozen men some of them a little better off than he was explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond Back out he suggested after a moment Put her in reverse But the wheels off He hesitated No harm in trying he said The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home I glanced back once A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsbys house making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell  Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs Most of the time I worked In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust I knew the other clerks and young bondsalesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away I took dinner usually at the Yale Clubfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work After that if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station I began to like New York the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove Sometimes in my mind I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life Again at eight oclock when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district I felt a sinking in my heart Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside Imagining that I too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement I wished them well For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker and then in midsummer I found her again At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name Then it was something more I wasnt actually in love but I felt a sort of tender curiosity The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed somethingmost affectations conceal something eventually even though they dont in the beginningand one day I found what it was When we were on a houseparty together up in Warwick she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down and then lied about itand suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisys At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapersa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round The thing approached the proportions of a scandalthen died away A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken The incident and the name had remained together in my mind Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible She was incurably dishonest She wasnt able to endure being at a disadvantage and given this unwillingness I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body It made no difference to me Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyI was casually sorry and then I forgot It was on that same houseparty that we had a curious conversation about driving a car It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one mans coat Youre a rotten driver I protested Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtnt to drive at all I am careful No youre not Well other people are she said lightly Whats that got to do with it Theyll keep out of my way she insisted It takes two to make an accident Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself I hope I never will she answered I hate careless people Thats why I like you Her grey sunstrained eyes stared straight ahead but she had deliberately shifted our relations and for a moment I thought I loved her But I am slowthinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home Id been writing letters once a week and signing them Love Nick and all I could think of was how when that certain girl played tennis a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues and this is mine I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known IV On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore the world and its mistress returned to Gatsbys house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn Hes a bootlegger said the young ladies moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil Reach me a rose honey and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsbys house that summer It is an old timetable now disintegrating at its folds and headed This schedule in effect July th  But I can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsbys hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him From East Egg then came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in Maine And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near And the Ismays and the Chrysties or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr Chrysties wife and Edgar Beaver whose hair they say turned cottonwhite one winter afternoon for no good reason at all Clarence Endive was from East Egg as I remember He came only once in white knickerbockers and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O R P Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs Ulysses Swetts automobile ran over his right hand The Dancies came too and S B Whitebait who was well over sixty and Maurice A Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Belugas girls From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S Schwartz the son and Arthur McCarty all connected with the movies in one way or another And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G Earl Muldoon brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife Da Fontano the promoter came there and Ed Legros and James B RotGut Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lillythey came to gamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as the boarderI doubt if he had any other home Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace ODonavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S W Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns divorced now and Henry L Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before I have forgotten their namesJaqueline I think or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins if pressed they would confess themselves to be In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina OBrien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr Albrucksburger and Miss Haag his fiance and Ardita FitzPeters and Mr P Jewett once head of the American Legion and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name if I ever knew it I have forgotten All these people came to Gatsbys house in the summer  At nine oclock one morning late in July Gatsbys gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its threenoted horn It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties mounted in his hydroplane and at his urgent invitation made frequent use of his beach Good morning old sport Youre having lunch with me today and I thought wed ride up together He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly Americanthat comes I suppose with the absence of lifting work in youth and even more with the formless grace of our nervous sporadic games This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness He was never quite still there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand He saw me looking with admiration at his car Its pretty isnt it old sport He jumped off to give me a better view Havent you ever seen it before Id seen it Everybody had seen it It was a rich cream colour bright with nickel swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supperboxes and toolboxes and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found to my disappointment that he had little to say So my first impression that he was a person of some undefined consequence had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door And then came that disconcerting ride We hadnt reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramelcoloured suit Look here old sport he broke out surprisingly whats your opinion of me anyhow A little overwhelmed I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves Well Im going to tell you something about my life he interrupted I dont want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls Ill tell you Gods truth His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle Westall dead now I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years It is a family tradition He looked at me sidewaysand I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying He hurried the phrase educated at Oxford or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before And with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasnt something a little sinister about him after all What part of the Middle West I inquired casually San Francisco I see My family all died and I came into a good deal of money His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of EuropeParis Venice Romecollecting jewels chiefly rubies hunting big game painting a little things for myself only and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned character leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne Then came the war old sport It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machinegun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldnt advance We stayed there two days and two nights a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decorationeven Montenegro little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea Little Montenegro He lifted up the words and nodded at themwith his smile The smile comprehended Montenegros troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegros warm little heart My incredulity was submerged in fascination now it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal slung on a ribbon fell into my palm Thats the one from Montenegro To my astonishment the thing had an authentic look Orderi di Danilo ran the circular legend Montenegro Nicolas Rex Turn it Major Jay Gatsby I read For Valour Extraordinary Heres another thing I always carry A souvenir of Oxford days It was taken in Trinity Quadthe man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires There was Gatsby looking a little not much youngerwith a cricket bat in his hand Then it was all true I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease with their crimsonlighted depths the gnawings of his broken heart Im going to make a big request of you today he said pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction so I thought you ought to know something about me I didnt want you to think I was just some nobody You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me He hesitated Youll hear about it this afternoon At lunch No this afternoon I happened to find out that youre taking Miss Baker to tea Do you mean youre in love with Miss Baker No old sport Im not But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter I hadnt the faintest idea what this matter was but I was more annoyed than interested I hadnt asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr Jay Gatsby I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I was sorry Id ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn He wouldnt say another word His correctness grew on him as we neared the city We passed Port Roosevelt where there was a glimpse of redbelted oceangoing ships and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark undeserted saloons of the fadedgilt nineteenhundreds Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us and I had a glimpse of Mrs Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoriaonly half for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar jugjugspat of a motorcycle and a frantic policeman rode alongside All right old sport called Gatsby We slowed down Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the mans eyes Right you are agreed the policeman tipping his cap Know you next time Mr Gatsby Excuse me What was that I inquired The picture of Oxford I was able to do the commissioner a favour once and he sends me a Christmas card every year Over the great bridge with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe and I was glad that the sight of Gatsbys splendid car was included in their sombre holiday As we crossed Blackwells Island a limousine passed us driven by a white chauffeur in which sat three modish negroes two bucks and a girl I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry Anything can happen now that weve slid over this bridge I thought anything at all  Even Gatsby could happen without any particular wonder  Roaring noon In a wellfanned Fortysecond Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom talking to another man Mr Carraway this is my friend Mr Wolfshiem A small flatnosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the halfdarkness So I took one look at him said Mr Wolfshiem shaking my hand earnestly and what do you think I did What I inquired politely But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said All right Katspaugh dont pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth He shut it then and there Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon Mr Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction Highballs asked the head waiter This is a nice restaurant here said Mr Wolfshiem looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling But I like across the street better Yes highballs agreed Gatsby and then to Mr Wolfshiem Its too hot over there Hot and smallyes said Mr Wolfshiem but full of memories What place is that I asked The old Metropole The old Metropole brooded Mr Wolfshiem gloomily Filled with faces dead and gone Filled with friends gone now forever I cant forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside All right says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair  Let the bastards come in here if they want you Rosy but dont you so help me move outside this room It was four oclock in the morning then and if wed of raised the blinds wed of seen daylight Did he go I asked innocently Sure he went Mr Wolfshiems nose flashed at me indignantly He turned around in the door and says Dont let that waiter take away my coffee Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away Four of them were electrocuted I said remembering Five with Becker His nostrils turned to me in an interested way I understand youre looking for a business gonnegtion The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling Gatsby answered for me Oh no he exclaimed this isnt the man No Mr Wolfshiem seemed disappointed This is just a friend I told you wed talk about that some other time I beg your pardon said Mr Wolfshiem I had a wrong man A succulent hash arrived and Mr Wolfshiem forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole began to eat with ferocious delicacy His eyes meanwhile roved very slowly all around the roomhe completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind I think that except for my presence he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table Look here old sport said Gatsby leaning toward me Im afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car There was the smile again but this time I held out against it I dont like mysteries I answered and I dont understand why you wont come out frankly and tell me what you want Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker Oh its nothing underhand he assured me Miss Bakers a great sportswoman you know and shed never do anything that wasnt all right Suddenly he looked at his watch jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with Mr Wolfshiem at the table He has to telephone said Mr Wolfshiem following him with his eyes Fine fellow isnt he Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman Yes Hes an Oggsford man Oh He went to Oggsford College in England You know Oggsford College Ive heard of it Its one of the most famous colleges in the world Have you known Gatsby for a long time I inquired Several years he answered in a gratified way I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour I said to myself Theres the kind of man youd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister  He paused I see youre looking at my cuff buttons I hadnt been looking at them but I did now They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory Finest specimens of human molars he informed me Well I inspected them Thats a very interesting idea Yeah He flipped his sleeves up under his coat Yeah Gatsbys very careful about women He would never so much as look at a friends wife When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet I have enjoyed my lunch he said and Im going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome Dont hurry Meyer said Gatsby without enthusiasm Mr Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction Youre very polite but I belong to another generation he announced solemnly You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand As for me I am fifty years old and I wont impose myself on you any longer As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling I wondered if I had said anything to offend him He becomes very sentimental sometimes explained Gatsby This is one of his sentimental days Hes quite a character around New Yorka denizen of Broadway Who is he anyhow an actor No A dentist Meyer Wolfshiem No hes a gambler Gatsby hesitated then added coolly Hes the man who fixed the Worlds Series back in  Fixed the Worlds Series I repeated The idea staggered me I remembered of course that the Worlds Series had been fixed in  but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened the end of some inevitable chain It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million peoplewith the singlemindedness of a burglar blowing a safe How did he happen to do that I asked after a minute He just saw the opportunity Why isnt he in jail They cant get him old sport Hes a smart man I insisted on paying the check As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room Come along with me for a minute I said Ive got to say hello to someone When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction Whereve you been he demanded eagerly Daisys furious because you havent called up This is Mr Gatsby Mr Buchanan They shook hands briefly and a strained unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsbys face Howve you been anyhow demanded Tom of me Howd you happen to come up this far to eat Ive been having lunch with Mr Gatsby I turned toward Mr Gatsby but he was no longer there  One October day in nineteenseventeen said Jordan Baker that afternoon sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the teagarden at the Plaza Hotel I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tuttuttuttut in a disapproving way The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fays house She was just eighteen two years older than me and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville She dressed in white and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night Anyways for an hour When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before They were so engrossed in each other that she didnt see me until I was five feet away Hello Jordan she called unexpectedly Please come here I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me because of all the older girls I admired her most She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages I was Well then would I tell them that she couldnt come that day The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since His name was Jay Gatsby and I didnt lay eyes on him again for over four yearseven after Id met him on Long Island I didnt realize it was the same man That was nineteenseventeen By the next year I had a few beaux myself and I began to play in tournaments so I didnt see Daisy very often She went with a slightly older crowdwhen she went with anyone at all Wild rumours were circulating about herhow her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas She was effectually prevented but she wasnt on speaking terms with her family for several weeks After that she didnt play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flatfooted shortsighted young men in town who couldnt get into the army at all By the next autumn she was gay again gay as ever She had a dbut after the armistice and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars I was a bridesmaid I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dressand as drunk as a monkey She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other  Gratulate me she muttered Never had a drink before but oh how I do enjoy it Whats the matter Daisy I was scared I can tell you Id never seen a girl like that before Here dearies She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls Take em downstairs and give em back to whoever they belong to Tell em all Daisys change her mine Say Daisys change her mine  She began to cryshe cried and cried I rushed out and found her mothers maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath She wouldnt let go of the letter She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball and only let me leave it in the soapdish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow But she didnt say another word We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over Next day at five oclock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months trip to the South Seas I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought Id never seen a girl so mad about her husband If he left the room for a minute shed look around uneasily and say Wheres Tom gone and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight It was touching to see them togetherit made you laugh in a hushed fascinated way That was in August A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car The girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was brokenshe was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down Daisy was popular in Chicago as you know They moved with a fast crowd all of them young and rich and wild but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation Perhaps because she doesnt drink Its a great advantage not to drink among harddrinking people You can hold your tongue and moreover you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they dont see or care Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at alland yet theres something in that voice of hers  Well about six weeks ago she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years It was when I asked youdo you rememberif you knew Gatsby in West Egg After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up and said What Gatsby and when I described himI was half asleepshe said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know It wasnt until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car  When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of children already gathered like crickets on the grass rose through the hot twilight Im the Sheik of Araby Your love belongs to me At night when youre asleep Into your tent Ill creep It was a strange coincidence I said But it wasnt a coincidence at all Why not Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night He came alive to me delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour He wants to know continued Jordan if youll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over The modesty of the demand shook me He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual mothsso that he could come over some afternoon to a strangers garden Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing Hes afraid hes waited so long He thought you might be offended You see hes regular tough underneath it all Something worried me Why didnt he ask you to arrange a meeting He wants her to see his house she explained And your house is right next door Oh I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties some night went on Jordan but she never did Then he began asking people casually if they knew her and I was the first one he found It was that night he sent for me at his dance and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it Of course I immediately suggested a luncheon in New Yorkand I thought hed go mad  I dont want to do anything out of the way he kept saying I want to see her right next door When I said you were a particular friend of Toms he started to abandon the whole idea He doesnt know very much about Tom though he says hes read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisys name It was dark now and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordans golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner Suddenly I wasnt thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean hard limited person who dealt in universal scepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement There are only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired And Daisy ought to have something in her life murmured Jordan to me Does she want to see Gatsby Shes not to know about it Gatsby doesnt want her to know Youre just supposed to invite her to tea We passed a barrier of dark trees and then the faade of FiftyNinth Street a block of delicate pale light beamed down into the park Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me tightening my arms Her wan scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again closer this time to my face V When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire Two oclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsbys house lit from tower to cellar At first I thought it was another party a wild rout that had resolved itself into hideandgoseek or sardinesinthebox with all the house thrown open to the game But there wasnt a sound Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn Your place looks like the Worlds Fair I said Does it He turned his eyes toward it absently I have been glancing into some of the rooms Lets go to Coney Island old sport In my car Its too late Well suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool I havent made use of it all summer Ive got to go to bed All right He waited looking at me with suppressed eagerness I talked with Miss Baker I said after a moment Im going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea Oh thats all right he said carelessly I dont want to put you to any trouble What day would suit you What day would suit you he corrected me quickly I dont want to put you to any trouble you see How about the day after tomorrow He considered for a moment Then with reluctance I want to get the grass cut he said We both looked down at the grassthere was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker wellkept expanse of his began I suspected that he meant my grass Theres another little thing he said uncertainly and hesitated Would you rather put it off for a few days I asked Oh it isnt about that At least He fumbled with a series of beginnings Why I thoughtwhy look here old sport you dont make much money do you Not very much This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently I thought you didnt if youll pardon myyou see I carry on a little business on the side a sort of side line you understand And I thought that if you dont make very muchYoure selling bonds arent you old sport Trying to Well this would interest you It wouldnt take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life But because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered I had no choice except to cut him off there Ive got my hands full I said Im much obliged but I couldnt take on any more work You wouldnt have to do any business with Wolfshiem Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the gonnegtion mentioned at lunch but I assured him he was wrong He waited a moment longer hoping Id begin a conversation but I was too absorbed to be responsive so he went unwillingly home The evening had made me lightheaded and happy I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door So I dont know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he glanced into rooms while his house blazed gaudily on I called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea Dont bring Tom I warned her What Dont bring Tom Who is Tom she asked innocently The day agreed upon was pouring rain At eleven oclock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawnmower tapped at my front door and said that Mr Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers The flowers were unnecessary for at two oclock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsbys with innumerable receptacles to contain it An hour later the front door opened nervously and Gatsby in a white flannel suit silver shirt and goldcoloured tie hurried in He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes Is everything all right he asked immediately The grass looks fine if thats what you mean What grass he inquired blankly Oh the grass in the yard He looked out the window at it but judging from his expression I dont believe he saw a thing Looks very good he remarked vaguely One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four I think it was The Journal Have you got everything you need in the shape ofof tea I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop Will they do I asked Of course of course Theyre fine and he added hollowly  old sport The rain cooled about halfpast three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clays Economics starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home Whys that Nobodys coming to tea Its too late He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere I cant wait all day Dont be silly its just two minutes to four He sat down miserably as if I had pushed him and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane We both jumped up and a little harrowed myself I went out into the yard Under the dripping bare lilactrees a large open car was coming up the drive It stopped Daisys face tipped sideways beneath a threecornered lavender hat looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile Is this absolutely where you live my dearest one The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain I had to follow the sound of it for a moment up and down with my ear alone before any words came through A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car Are you in love with me she said low in my ear or why did I have to come alone Thats the secret of Castle Rackrent Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour Come back in an hour Ferdie Then in a grave murmur His name is Ferdie Does the gasoline affect his nose I dont think so she said innocently Why We went in To my overwhelming surprise the livingroom was deserted Well thats funny I exclaimed Whats funny She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door I went out and opened it Gatsby pale as death with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the livingroom It wasnt a bit funny Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain For half a minute there wasnt a sound Then from the livingroom I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisys voice on a clear artificial note I certainly am awfully glad to see you again A pause it endured horribly I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room Gatsby his hands still in his pockets was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease even of boredom His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair Weve met before muttered Gatsby His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place Then he sat down rigidly his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand Im sorry about the clock he said My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn I couldnt muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head Its an old clock I told them idiotically I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor We havent met for many years said Daisy her voice as matteroffact as it could ever be Five years next November The automatic quality of Gatsbys answer set us all back at least another minute I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes However as calmness wasnt an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet Where are you going demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm Ill be back Ive got to speak to you about something before you go He followed me wildly into the kitchen closed the door and whispered Oh God in a miserable way Whats the matter This is a terrible mistake he said shaking his head from side to side a terrible terrible mistake Youre just embarrassed thats all and luckily I added Daisys embarrassed too Shes embarrassed he repeated incredulously Just as much as you are Dont talk so loud Youre acting like a little boy I broke out impatiently Not only that but youre rude Daisys sitting in there all alone He raised his hand to stop my words looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room I walked out the back wayjust as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour beforeand ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn wellshaved by Gatsbys gardener abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsbys enormous house so I stared at it like Kant at his church steeple for half an hour A brewer had built it early in the period craze a decade before and there was a story that hed agreed to pay five years taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Familyhe went into an immediate decline His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door Americans while willing even eager to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocers automobile rounded Gatsbys drive with the raw material for his servants dinnerI felt sure he wouldnt eat a spoonful A maid began opening the upper windows of his house appeared momentarily in each and leaning from the large central bay spat meditatively into the garden It was time I went back While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too I went inafter making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stovebut I dont believe they heard a sound They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air and every vestige of embarrassment was gone Daisys face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding He literally glowed without a word or a gesture of exultation a new wellbeing radiated from him and filled the little room Oh hello old sport he said as if he hadnt seen me for years I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands Its stopped raining Has it When he realized what I was talking about that there were twinklebells of sunshine in the room he smiled like a weather man like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light and repeated the news to Daisy What do you think of that Its stopped raining Im glad Jay Her throat full of aching grieving beauty told only of her unexpected joy I want you and Daisy to come over to my house he said Id like to show her around Youre sure you want me to come Absolutely old sport Daisy went upstairs to wash her facetoo late I thought with humiliation of my towelswhile Gatsby and I waited on the lawn My house looks well doesnt it he demanded See how the whole front of it catches the light I agreed that it was splendid Yes His eyes went over it every arched door and square tower It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it I thought you inherited your money I did old sport he said automatically but I lost most of it in the big panicthe panic of the war I think he hardly knew what he was saying for when I asked him what business he was in he answered Thats my affair before he realized that it wasnt an appropriate reply Oh Ive been in several things he corrected himself I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business But Im not in either one now He looked at me with more attention Do you mean youve been thinking over what I proposed the other night Before I could answer Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight That huge place there she cried pointing Do you like it I love it but I dont see how you live there all alone I keep it always full of interesting people night and day People who do interesting things Celebrated people Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky admired the gardens the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kissmeatthegate It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette musicrooms and Restoration Salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through As Gatsby closed the door of the Merton College Library I could have sworn I heard the owleyed man break into ghostly laughter We went upstairs through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers through dressingrooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunken bathsintruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor It was Mr Klipspringer the boarder I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning Finally we came to Gatsbys own apartment a bedroom and a bath and an Adams study where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall He hadnt once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her wellloved eyes Sometimes too he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs His bedroom was the simplest room of allexcept where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh Its the funniest thing old sport he said hilariously I cantWhen I try to He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence He had been full of the idea so long dreamed it right through to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at an inconceivable pitch of intensity Now in the reaction he was running down like an overwound clock Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressinggowns and ties and his shirts piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high Ive got a man in England who buys me clothes He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season spring and fall He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in manycoloured disarray While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted highershirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and applegreen and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily Theyre such beautiful shirts she sobbed her voice muffled in the thick folds It makes me sad because Ive never seen suchsuch beautiful shirts before  After the house we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowersbut outside Gatsbys window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound If it wasnt for the mist we could see your home across the bay said Gatsby You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her almost touching her It had seemed as close as a star to the moon Now it was again a green light on a dock His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one I began to walk about the room examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me hung on the wall over his desk Whos this That Thats Mr Dan Cody old sport The name sounded faintly familiar Hes dead now He used to be my best friend years ago There was a small picture of Gatsby also in yachting costume on the bureauGatsby with his head thrown back defiantlytaken apparently when he was about eighteen I adore it exclaimed Daisy The pompadour You never told me you had a pompadouror a yacht Look at this said Gatsby quickly Heres a lot of clippingsabout you They stood side by side examining it I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver Yes  Well I cant talk now  I cant talk now old sport  I said a small town  He must know what a small town is  Well hes no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town  He rang off Come here quick cried Daisy at the window The rain was still falling but the darkness had parted in the west and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea Look at that she whispered and then after a moment Id like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around I tried to go then but they wouldnt hear of it perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone I know what well do said Gatsby well have Klipspringer play the piano He went out of the room calling Ewing and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed slightly worn young man with shellrimmed glasses and scanty blond hair He was now decently clothed in a sport shirt open at the neck sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue Did we interrupt your exercise inquired Daisy politely I was asleep cried Mr Klipspringer in a spasm of embarrassment That is Id been asleep Then I got up  Klipspringer plays the piano said Gatsby cutting him off Dont you Ewing old sport I dont play well I donthardly play at all Im all out of prac Well go downstairs interrupted Gatsby He flipped a switch The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light In the musicroom Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano He lit Daisys cigarette from a trembling match and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom Im all out of practice you see I told you I couldnt play Im all out of prac Dont talk so much old sport commanded Gatsby Play In the morning In the evening Aint we got fun Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound All the lights were going on in West Egg now the electric trains mencarrying were plunging home through the rain from New York It was the hour of a profound human change and excitement was generating on the air One things sure and nothings surer The rich get richer and the poor getchildren In the meantime In between time As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsbys face as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness Almost five years There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreamsnot through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion It had gone beyond her beyond everything He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion adding to it all the time decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart As I watched him he adjusted himself a little visibly His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating feverish warmth because it couldnt be overdreamedthat voice was a deathless song They had forgotten me but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand Gatsby didnt know me now at all I looked once more at them and they looked back at me remotely possessed by intense life Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain leaving them there together VI About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsbys door and asked him if he had anything to say Anything to say about what inquired Gatsby politely Whyany statement to give out It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsbys name around his office in a connection which he either wouldnt reveal or didnt fully understand This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out to see It was a random shot and yet the reporters instinct was right Gatsbys notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news Contemporary legends such as the underground pipeline to Canada attached themselves to him and there was one persistent story that he didnt live in a house at all but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota isnt easy to say James Gatzthat was really or at least legally his name He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his careerwhen he saw Dan Codys yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat pulled out to the Tuolomee and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour I suppose hed had the name ready for a long time even then His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peoplehis imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg Long Island sprang from his Platonic conception of himself He was a son of Goda phrase which if it means anything means just thatand he must be about His Fathers business the service of a vast vulgar and meretricious beauty So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeenyearold boy would be likely to invent and to this conception he was faithful to the end For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clamdigger and a salmonfisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed His brown hardening body lived naturally through the halffierce halflazy work of the bracing days He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them of young virgins because they were ignorant of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming selfabsorption he took for granted But his heart was in a constant turbulent riot The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairys wing An instinct toward his future glory had led him some months before to the small Lutheran College of St Olafs in southern Minnesota He stayed there two weeks dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny to destiny itself and despising the janitors work with which he was to pay his way through Then he drifted back to Lake Superior and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Codys yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore Cody was fifty years old then a product of the Nevada silver fields of the Yukon of every rush for metal since seventyfive The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of softmindedness and suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye the newspaper woman played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht were common property of the turgid journalism in  He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatzs destiny in Little Girl Bay To young Gatz resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world I suppose he smiled at Codyhe had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled At any rate Cody asked him a few questions one of them elicited the brand new name and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat six pairs of white duck trousers and a yachting cap And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too He was employed in a vague personal capacitywhile he remained with Cody he was in turn steward mate skipper secretary and even jailor for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the Continent It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsbys bedroom a grey florid man with a hard empty facethe pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone And it was from Cody that he inherited moneya legacy of twentyfive thousand dollars He didnt get it He never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye He was left with his singularly appropriate education the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man  He told me all this very much later but Ive put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents which werent even faintly true Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him So I take advantage of this short halt while Gatsby so to speak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptions away It was a halt too in my association with his affairs For several weeks I didnt see him or hear his voice on the phonemostly I was in New York trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile auntbut finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon I hadnt been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink I was startled naturally but the really surprising thing was that it hadnt happened before They were a party of three on horsebackTom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown ridinghabit who had been there previously Im delighted to see you said Gatsby standing on his porch Im delighted that you dropped in As though they cared Sit right down Have a cigarette or a cigar He walked around the room quickly ringing bells Ill have something to drink for you in just a minute He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for Mr Sloane wanted nothing A lemonade No thanks A little champagne Nothing at all thanks  Im sorry Did you have a nice ride Very good roads around here I suppose the automobiles Yeah Moved by an irresistible impulse Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger I believe weve met somewhere before Mr Buchanan Oh yes said Tom gruffly polite but obviously not remembering So we did I remember very well About two weeks ago Thats right You were with Nick here I know your wife continued Gatsby almost aggressively That so Tom turned to me You live near here Nick Next door That so Mr Sloane didnt enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing eitheruntil unexpectedly after two highballs she became cordial Well all come over to your next party Mr Gatsby she suggested What do you say Certainly Id be delighted to have you Be ver nice said Mr Sloane without gratitude Wellthink ought to be starting home Please dont hurry Gatsby urged them He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom Why dont youwhy dont you stay for supper I wouldnt be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York You come to supper with me said the lady enthusiastically Both of you This included me Mr Sloane got to his feet Come along he saidbut to her only I mean it she insisted Id love to have you Lots of room Gatsby looked at me questioningly He wanted to go and he didnt see that Mr Sloane had determined he shouldnt Im afraid I wont be able to I said Well you come she urged concentrating on Gatsby Mr Sloane murmured something close to her ear We wont be late if we start now she insisted aloud I havent got a horse said Gatsby I used to ride in the army but Ive never bought a horse Ill have to follow you in my car Excuse me for just a minute The rest of us walked out on the porch where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside My God I believe the mans coming said Tom Doesnt he know she doesnt want him She says she does want him She has a big dinner party and he wont know a soul there He frowned I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy By God I may be oldfashioned in my ideas but women run around too much these days to suit me They meet all kinds of crazy fish Suddenly Mr Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses Come on said Mr Sloane to Tom were late Weve got to go And then to me Tell him we couldnt wait will you Tom and I shook hands the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisys running around alone for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsbys party Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressivenessit stands out in my memory from Gatsbys other parties that summer There were the same people or at least the same sort of people the same profusion of champagne the same manycoloured manykeyed commotion but I felt an unpleasantness in the air a pervading harshness that hadnt been there before Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself with its own standards and its own great figures second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so and now I was looking at it again through Daisys eyes It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisys voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat These things excite me so she whispered If you want to kiss me any time during the evening Nick just let me know and Ill be glad to arrange it for you Just mention my name Or present a green card Im giving out green Look around suggested Gatsby Im looking around Im having a marvellous You must see the faces of many people youve heard about Toms arrogant eyes roamed the crowd We dont go around very much he said in fact I was just thinking I dont know a soul here Perhaps you know that lady Gatsby indicated a gorgeous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a whiteplum tree Tom and Daisy stared with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies Shes lovely said Daisy The man bending over her is her director He took them ceremoniously from group to group Mrs Buchanan  and Mr Buchanan After an instants hesitation he added the polo player Oh no objected Tom quickly not me But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained the polo player for the rest of the evening Ive never met so many celebrities Daisy exclaimed I liked that manwhat was his namewith the sort of blue nose Gatsby identified him adding that he was a small producer Well I liked him anyhow Id a little rather not be the polo player said Tom pleasantly Id rather look at all these famous people inin oblivion Daisy and Gatsby danced I remember being surprised by his graceful conservative foxtrotI had never seen him dance before Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden In case theres a fire or a flood she explained or any act of God Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together Do you mind if I eat with some people over here he said A fellows getting off some funny stuff Go ahead answered Daisy genially and if you want to take down any addresses heres my little gold pencil  She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty and I knew that except for the halfhour shed been alone with Gatsby she wasnt having a good time We were at a particularly tipsy table That was my faultGatsby had been called to the phone and Id enjoyed these same people only two weeks before But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now How do you feel Miss Baedeker The girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slump against my shoulder At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes Wha A massive and lethargic woman who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow spoke in Miss Baedekers defence Oh shes all right now When shes had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that I tell her she ought to leave it alone I do leave it alone affirmed the accused hollowly We heard you yelling so I said to Doc Civet here Theres somebody that needs your help Doc  Shes much obliged Im sure said another friend without gratitude but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool mumbled Miss Baedeker They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey Then you ought to leave it alone countered Doctor Civet Speak for yourself cried Miss Baedeker violently Your hand shakes I wouldnt let you operate on me It was like that Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the movingpicture director and his Star They were still under the whiteplum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek I like her said Daisy I think shes lovely But the rest offended herand inarguably because it wasnt a gesture but an emotion She was appalled by West Egg this unprecedented place that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing villageappalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car It was dark here in front only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressingroom blind above gave way to another shadow an indefinite procession of shadows who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass Who is this Gatsby anyhow demanded Tom suddenly Some big bootlegger Whered you hear that I inquired I didnt hear it I imagined it A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers you know Not Gatsby I said shortly He was silent for a moment The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet Well he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisys fur collar At least they are more interesting than the people we know she said with an effort You didnt look so interested Well I was Tom laughed and turned to me Did you notice Daisys face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it in a way contralto voices have and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air Lots of people come who havent been invited she said suddenly That girl hadnt been invited They simply force their way in and hes too polite to object Id like to know who he is and what he does insisted Tom And I think Ill make a point of finding out I can tell you right now she answered He owned some drugstores a lot of drugstores He built them up himself The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive Good night Nick said Daisy Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where Three OClock in the Morning a neat sad little waltz of that year was drifting out the open door After all in the very casualness of Gatsbys party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby one moment of magical encounter would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion I stayed late that night Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up chilled and exalted from the black beach until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and his eyes were bright and tired She didnt like it he said immediately Of course she did She didnt like it he insisted She didnt have a good time He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression I feel far away from her he said Its hard to make her understand You mean about the dance The dance He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers Old sport the dance is unimportant He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say I never loved you After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken One of them was that after she was free they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her housejust as if it were five years ago And she doesnt understand he said She used to be able to understand Wed sit for hours He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers I wouldnt ask too much of her I ventured You cant repeat the past Cant repeat the past he cried incredulously Why of course you can He looked around him wildly as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of his hand Im going to fix everything just the way it was before he said nodding determinedly Shell see He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something some idea of himself perhaps that had gone into loving Daisy His life had been confused and disordered since then but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly he could find out what that thing was   One autumn night five years before they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight They stopped here and turned toward each other Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the treeshe could climb to it if he climbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap of life gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder His heart beat faster as Daisys white face came up to his own He knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of God So he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuningfork that had been struck upon a star Then he kissed her At his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete Through all he said even through his appalling sentimentality I was reminded of somethingan elusive rhythm a fragment of lost words that I had heard somewhere a long time ago For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb mans as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever VII It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightand as obscurely as it had begun his career as Trimalchio was over Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away Wondering if he were sick I went over to find outan unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door Is Mr Gatsby sick Nope After a pause he added sir in a dilatory grudging way I hadnt seen him around and I was rather worried Tell him Mr Carraway came over Who he demanded rudely Carraway Carraway All right Ill tell him Abruptly he slammed the door My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty and the general opinion in the village was that the new people werent servants at all Next day Gatsby called me on the phone Going away I inquired No old sport I hear you fired all your servants I wanted somebody who wouldnt gossip Daisy comes over quite oftenin the afternoons So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes Theyre some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for Theyre all brothers and sisters They used to run a small hotel I see He was calling up at Daisys requestwould I come to lunch at her house tomorrow Miss Baker would be there Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming Something was up And yet I couldnt believe that they would choose this occasion for a sceneespecially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden The next day was broiling almost the last certainly the warmest of the summer As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist and then as her newspaper dampened under her fingers lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry Her pocketbook slapped to the floor Oh my she gasped I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her holding it at arms length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon itbut everyone near by including the woman suspected me just the same Hot said the conductor to familiar faces Some weather  Hot  Hot  Hot  Is it hot enough for you Is it hot Is it   My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart  Through the hall of the Buchanans house blew a faint wind carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door The masters body roared the butler into the mouthpiece Im sorry madame but we cant furnish itits far too hot to touch this noon What he really said was Yes  Yes  Ill see He set down the receiver and came toward us glistening slightly to take our stiff straw hats Madame expects you in the salon he cried needlessly indicating the direction In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life The room shadowed well with awnings was dark and cool Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans We cant move they said together Jordans fingers powdered white over their tan rested for a moment in mine And Mr Thomas Buchanan the athlete I inquired Simultaneously I heard his voice gruff muffled husky at the hall telephone Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes Daisy watched him and laughed her sweet exciting laugh a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air The rumour is whispered Jordan that thats Toms girl on the telephone We were silent The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance Very well then I wont sell you the car at all  Im under no obligations to you at all  and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I wont stand that at all Holding down the receiver said Daisy cynically No hes not I assured her Its a bonafide deal I happen to know about it Tom flung open the door blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body and hurried into the room Mr Gatsby He put out his broad flat hand with wellconcealed dislike Im glad to see you sir  Nick  Make us a cold drink cried Daisy As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth You know I love you she murmured You forget theres a lady present said Jordan Daisy looked around doubtfully You kiss Nick too What a low vulgar girl I dont care cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room Blessed precious she crooned holding out her arms Come to your own mother that loves you The child relinquished by the nurse rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mothers dress The blessed precious Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair Stand up now and sayHowdedo Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise I dont think he had ever really believed in its existence before I got dressed before luncheon said the child turning eagerly to Daisy Thats because your mother wanted to show you off Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck You dream you You absolute little dream Yes admitted the child calmly Aunt Jordans got on a white dress too How do you like mothers friends Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby Do you think theyre pretty Wheres Daddy She doesnt look like her father explained Daisy She looks like me Shes got my hair and shape of the face Daisy sat back upon the couch The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand Come Pammy Goodbye sweetheart With a reluctant backward glance the welldisciplined child held to her nurses hand and was pulled out the door just as Tom came back preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice Gatsby took up his drink They certainly look cool he said with visible tension We drank in long greedy swallows I read somewhere that the suns getting hotter every year said Tom genially It seems that pretty soon the earths going to fall into the sunor wait a minuteits just the oppositethe suns getting colder every year Come outside he suggested to Gatsby Id like you to have a look at the place I went with them out to the veranda On the green Sound stagnant in the heat one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea Gatsbys eyes followed it momentarily he raised his hand and pointed across the bay Im right across from you So you are Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dogdays alongshore Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles Theres sport for you said Tom nodding Id like to be out there with him for about an hour We had luncheon in the diningroom darkened too against the heat and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale Whatll we do with ourselves this afternoon cried Daisy and the day after that and the next thirty years Dont be morbid Jordan said Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall But its so hot insisted Daisy on the verge of tears and everythings so confused Lets all go to town Her voice struggled on through the heat beating against it moulding its senselessness into forms Ive heard of making a garage out of a stable Tom was saying to Gatsby but Im the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage Who wants to go to town demanded Daisy insistently Gatsbys eyes floated toward her Ah she cried you look so cool Their eyes met and they stared together at each other alone in space With an effort she glanced down at the table You always look so cool she repeated She had told him that she loved him and Tom Buchanan saw He was astounded His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago You resemble the advertisement of the man she went on innocently You know the advertisement of the man All right broke in Tom quickly Im perfectly willing to go to town Come onwere all going to town He got up his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife No one moved Come on His temper cracked a little Whats the matter anyhow If were going to town lets start His hand trembling with his effort at selfcontrol bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale Daisys voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive Are we just going to go she objected Like this Arent we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first Everybody smoked all through lunch Oh lets have fun she begged him Its too hot to fuss He didnt answer Have it your own way she said Come on Jordan They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky Gatsby started to speak changed his mind but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly Have you got your stables here asked Gatsby with an effort About a quarter of a mile down the road Oh A pause I dont see the idea of going to town broke out Tom savagely Women get these notions in their heads Shall we take anything to drink called Daisy from an upper window Ill get some whisky answered Tom He went inside Gatsby turned to me rigidly I cant say anything in his house old sport Shes got an indiscreet voice I remarked Its full of I hesitated Her voice is full of money he said suddenly That was it Id never understood before It was full of moneythat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it the jingle of it the cymbals song of it  High in a white palace the kings daughter the golden girl  Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms Shall we all go in my car suggested Gatsby He felt the hot green leather of the seat I ought to have left it in the shade Is it standard shift demanded Tom Yes Well you take my coup and let me drive your car to town The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby I dont think theres much gas he objected Plenty of gas said Tom boisterously He looked at the gauge And if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore You can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays A pause followed this apparently pointless remark Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable as if I had only heard it described in words passed over Gatsbys face Come on Daisy said Tom pressing her with his hand toward Gatsbys car Ill take you in this circus wagon He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm You take Nick and Jordan Well follow you in the coup She walked close to Gatsby touching his coat with her hand Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsbys car Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind Did you see that demanded Tom See what He looked at me keenly realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along You think Im pretty dumb dont you he suggested Perhaps I am but I have aalmost a second sight sometimes that tells me what to do Maybe you dont believe that but science He paused The immediate contingency overtook him pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss Ive made a small investigation of this fellow he continued I could have gone deeper if Id known Do you mean youve been to a medium inquired Jordan humorously What Confused he stared at us as we laughed A medium About Gatsby About Gatsby No I havent I said Id been making a small investigation of his past And you found he was an Oxford man said Jordan helpfully An Oxford man He was incredulous Like hell he is He wears a pink suit Nevertheless hes an Oxford man Oxford New Mexico snorted Tom contemptuously or something like that Listen Tom If youre such a snob why did you invite him to lunch demanded Jordan crossly Daisy invited him she knew him before we were marriedGod knows where We were all irritable now with the fading ale and aware of it we drove for a while in silence Then as Doctor T J Eckleburgs faded eyes came into sight down the road I remembered Gatsbys caution about gasoline Weve got enough to get us to town said Tom But theres a garage right here objected Jordan I dont want to get stalled in this baking heat Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilsons sign After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed holloweyed at the car Lets have some gas cried Tom roughly What do you think we stopped forto admire the view Im sick said Wilson without moving Been sick all day Whats the matter Im all run down Well shall I help myself Tom demanded You sounded well enough on the phone With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and breathing hard unscrewed the cap of the tank In the sunlight his face was green I didnt mean to interrupt your lunch he said But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car How do you like this one inquired Tom I bought it last week Its a nice yellow one said Wilson as he strained at the handle Like to buy it Big chance Wilson smiled faintly No but I could make some money on the other What do you want money for all of a sudden Ive been here too long I want to get away My wife and I want to go West Your wife does exclaimed Tom startled Shes been talking about it for ten years He rested for a moment against the pump shading his eyes And now shes going whether she wants to or not Im going to get her away The coup flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand What do I owe you demanded Tom harshly I just got wised up to something funny the last two days remarked Wilson Thats why I want to get away Thats why I been bothering you about the car What do I owe you Dollar twenty The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadnt alighted on Tom He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick I stared at him and then at Tom who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour beforeand it occurred to me that there was no difference between men in intelligence or race so profound as the difference between the sick and the well Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty unforgivably guiltyas if he had just got some poor girl with child Ill let you have that car said Tom Ill send it over tomorrow afternoon That locality was always vaguely disquieting even in the broad glare of afternoon and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived after a moment that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture Her expression was curiously familiarit was an expression I had often seen on womens faces but on Myrtle Wilsons face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes wide with jealous terror were fixed not on Tom but on Jordan Baker whom she took to be his wife  There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic His wife and his mistress until an hour ago secure and inviolate were slipping precipitately from his control Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour until among the spidery girders of the elevated we came in sight of the easygoing blue coup Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool suggested Jordan I love New York on summer afternoons when everyones away Theres something very sensuous about itoverripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands The word sensuous had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coup came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside Where are we going she cried How about the movies Its so hot she complained You go Well ride around and meet you after With an effort her wit rose faintly Well meet you on some corner Ill be the man smoking two cigarettes We cant argue about it here Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us You follow me to the south side of Central Park in front of the Plaza Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight I think he was afraid they would dart down a sidestreet and out of his life forever But they didnt And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me though I have a sharp physical memory that in the course of it my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back The notion originated with Daisys suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep Each of us said over and over that it was a crazy ideawe all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought or pretended to think that we were being very funny  The room was large and stifling and though it was already four oclock opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us fixing her hair Its a swell suite whispered Jordan respectfully and everyone laughed Open another window commanded Daisy without turning around There arent any more Well wed better telephone for an axe The thing to do is to forget about the heat said Tom impatiently You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table Why not let her alone old sport remarked Gatsby Youre the one that wanted to come to town There was a moment of silence The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor whereupon Jordan whispered Excuse mebut this time no one laughed Ill pick it up I offered Ive got it Gatsby examined the parted string muttered Hum in an interested way and tossed the book on a chair Thats a great expression of yours isnt it said Tom sharply What is All this old sport business Whered you pick that up Now see here Tom said Daisy turning around from the mirror if youre going to make personal remarks I wont stay here a minute Call up and order some ice for the mint julep As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohns Wedding March from the ballroom below Imagine marrying anybody in this heat cried Jordan dismally StillI was married in the middle of June Daisy remembered Louisville in June Somebody fainted Who was it fainted Tom Biloxi he answered shortly A man named Biloxi Blocks Biloxi and he made boxesthats a factand he was from Biloxi Tennessee They carried him into my house appended Jordan because we lived just two doors from the church And he stayed three weeks until Daddy told him he had to get out The day after he left Daddy died After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent There wasnt any connection I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis I remarked That was his cousin I knew his whole family history before he left He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window followed by intermittent cries of Yeaeaea and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began Were getting old said Daisy If we were young wed rise and dance Remember Biloxi Jordan warned her Whered you know him Tom Biloxi He concentrated with an effort I didnt know him He was a friend of Daisys He was not she denied Id never seen him before He came down in the private car Well he said he knew you He said he was raised in Louisville Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him Jordan smiled He was probably bumming his way home He told me he was president of your class at Yale Tom and I looked at each other blankly Biloxi First place we didnt have any president Gatsbys foot beat a short restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly By the way Mr Gatsby I understand youre an Oxford man Not exactly Oh yes I understand you went to Oxford YesI went there A pause Then Toms voice incredulous and insulting You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven Another pause A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his thank you and the soft closing of the door This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last I told you I went there said Gatsby I heard you but Id like to know when It was in nineteennineteen I only stayed five months Thats why I cant really call myself an Oxford man Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief But we were all looking at Gatsby It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice he continued We could go to any of the universities in England or France I wanted to get up and slap him on the back I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that Id experienced before Daisy rose smiling faintly and went to the table Open the whisky Tom she ordered and Ill make you a mint julep Then you wont seem so stupid to yourself  Look at the mint Wait a minute snapped Tom I want to ask Mr Gatsby one more question Go on Gatsby said politely What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content He isnt causing a row Daisy looked desperately from one to the other Youre causing a row Please have a little selfcontrol Selfcontrol repeated Tom incredulously I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife Well if thats the idea you can count me out  Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next theyll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization Were all white here murmured Jordan I know Im not very popular I dont give big parties I suppose youve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friendsin the modern world Angry as I was as we all were I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth The transition from libertine to prig was so complete Ive got something to tell you old sport began Gatsby But Daisy guessed at his intention Please dont she interrupted helplessly Please lets all go home Why dont we all go home Thats a good idea I got up Come on Tom Nobody wants a drink I want to know what Mr Gatsby has to tell me Your wife doesnt love you said Gatsby Shes never loved you She loves me You must be crazy exclaimed Tom automatically Gatsby sprang to his feet vivid with excitement She never loved you do you hear he cried She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me It was a terrible mistake but in her heart she never loved anyone except me At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remainas though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions Sit down Daisy Toms voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note Whats been going on I want to hear all about it I told you whats been going on said Gatsby Going on for five yearsand you didnt know Tom turned to Daisy sharply Youve been seeing this fellow for five years Not seeing said Gatsby No we couldnt meet But both of us loved each other all that time old sport and you didnt know I used to laugh sometimesbut there was no laughter in his eyesto think that you didnt know Ohthats all Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair Youre crazy he exploded I cant speak about what happened five years ago because I didnt know Daisy thenand Ill be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door But all the rest of thats a God damned lie Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now No said Gatsby shaking his head She does though The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesnt know what shes doing He nodded sagely And whats more I love Daisy too Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself but I always come back and in my heart I love her all the time Youre revolting said Daisy She turned to me and her voice dropping an octave lower filled the room with thrilling scorn Do you know why we left Chicago Im surprised that they didnt treat you to the story of that little spree Gatsby walked over and stood beside her Daisy thats all over now he said earnestly It doesnt matter any more Just tell him the truththat you never loved himand its all wiped out forever She looked at him blindly Whyhow could I love himpossibly You never loved him She hesitated Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal as though she realized at last what she was doingand as though she had never all along intended doing anything at all But it was done now It was too late I never loved him she said with perceptible reluctance Not at Kapiolani demanded Tom suddenly No From the ballroom beneath muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry There was a husky tenderness in his tone  Daisy Please dont Her voice was cold but the rancour was gone from it She looked at Gatsby There Jay she saidbut her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet Oh you want too much she cried to Gatsby I love you nowisnt that enough I cant help whats past She began to sob helplessly I did love him oncebut I loved you too Gatsbys eyes opened and closed You loved me too he repeated Even thats a lie said Tom savagely She didnt know you were alive Whytheres things between Daisy and me that youll never know things that neither of us can ever forget The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby I want to speak to Daisy alone he insisted Shes all excited now Even alone I cant say I never loved Tom she admitted in a pitiful voice It wouldnt be true Of course it wouldnt agreed Tom She turned to her husband As if it mattered to you she said Of course it matters Im going to take better care of you from now on You dont understand said Gatsby with a touch of panic Youre not going to take care of her any more Im not Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed He could afford to control himself now Whys that Daisys leaving you Nonsense I am though she said with a visible effort Shes not leaving me Toms words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby Certainly not for a common swindler whod have to steal the ring he put on her finger I wont stand this cried Daisy Oh please lets get out Who are you anyhow broke out Tom Youre one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiemthat much I happen to know Ive made a little investigation into your affairsand Ill carry it further tomorrow You can suit yourself about that old sport said Gatsby steadily I found out what your drugstores were He turned to us and spoke rapidly He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of sidestreet drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter Thats one of his little stunts I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasnt far wrong What about it said Gatsby politely I guess your friend Walter Chase wasnt too proud to come in on it And you left him in the lurch didnt you You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey God You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you He came to us dead broke He was very glad to pick up some money old sport Dont you call me old sport cried Tom Gatsby said nothing Walter could have you up on the betting laws too but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsbys face That drugstore business was just small change continued Tom slowly but youve got something on now that Walters afraid to tell me about I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin Then I turned back to Gatsbyand was startled at his expression He lookedand this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his gardenas if he had killed a man For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way It passed and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy denying everything defending his name against accusations that had not been made But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away trying to touch what was no longer tangible struggling unhappily undespairingly toward that lost voice across the room The voice begged again to go Please Tom I cant stand this any more Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions whatever courage she had had were definitely gone You two start on home Daisy said Tom In Mr Gatsbys car She looked at Tom alarmed now but he insisted with magnanimous scorn Go on He wont annoy you I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over They were gone without a word snapped out made accidental isolated like ghosts even from our pity After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel Want any of this stuff Jordan  Nick I didnt answer Nick He asked again What Want any No  I just remembered that todays my birthday I was thirty Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade It was seven oclock when we got into the coup with him and started for Long Island Tom talked incessantly exulting and laughing but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind Thirtythe promise of a decade of loneliness a thinning list of single men to know a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm thinning hair But there was Jordan beside me who unlike Daisy was too wise ever to carry wellforgotten dreams from age to age As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coats shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight  The young Greek Michaelis who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest He had slept through the heat until after five when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his officereally sick pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson refused saying that hed miss a lot of business if he did While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead Ive got my wife locked in up there explained Wilson calmly Shes going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then were going to move away Michaelis was astonished they had been neighbours for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement Generally he was one of these wornout men when he wasnt working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable colourless way He was his wifes man and not his own So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened but Wilson wouldnt say a wordinstead he began to throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what hed been doing at certain times on certain days Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away intending to come back later But he didnt He supposed he forgot to thats all When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs Wilsons voice loud and scolding downstairs in the garage Beat me he heard her cry Throw me down and beat me you dirty little coward A moment later she rushed out into the dusk waving her hands and shoutingbefore he could move from his door the business was over The death car as the newspapers called it didnt stop it came out of the gathering darkness wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend Mavro Michaelis wasnt even sure of its colourhe told the first policeman that it was light green The other car the one going toward New York came to rest a hundred yards beyond and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson her life violently extinguished knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long  We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away Wreck said Tom Thats good Wilsonll have a little business at last He slowed down but still without any intention of stopping until as we came nearer the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes Well take a look he said doubtfully just a look I became aware now of a hollow wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage a sound which as we got out of the coup and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words Oh my God uttered over and over in a gasping moan Theres some bad trouble here said Tom excitedly He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation it was a minute before I could see anything at all Then new arrivals deranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside Myrtle Wilsons body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a worktable by the wall and Tom with his back to us was bending over it motionless Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book At first I couldnt find the source of the high groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garagethen I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder but Wilson neither heard nor saw His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call Oh my Gaod Oh my Gaod Oh Gaod Oh my Gaod Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman Mav the policeman was saying o No r corrected the man Mavro Listen to me muttered Tom fiercely r said the policeman o g g He looked up as Toms broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder What you want fella What happenedthats what I want to know Auto hit her Insantly killed Instantly killed repeated Tom staring She ran out ina road Sonofabitch didnt even stopus car There was two cars said Michaelis one comin one goin see Going where asked the policeman keenly One goin each way Well shehis hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his sideshe ran out there an the one comin from NYork knock right into her goin thirty or forty miles an hour Whats the name of this place here demanded the officer Hasnt got any name A pale welldressed negro stepped near It was a yellow car he said big yellow car New See the accident asked the policeman No but the car passed me down the road going fastern forty Going fifty sixty Come here and lets have your name Look out now I want to get his name Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying in the office door for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries You dont have to tell me what kind of car it was I know what kind of car it was Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms Youve got to pull yourself together he said with soothing gruffness Wilsons eyes fell upon Tom he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright Listen said Tom shaking him a little I just got here a minute ago from New York I was bringing you that coup weve been talking about That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasnt minedo you hear I havent seen it all afternoon Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes Whats all that he demanded Im a friend of his Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilsons body He says he knows the car that did it  It was a yellow car Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom And what colours your car Its a blue car a coup Weve come straight from New York I said Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away Now if youll let me have that name again correct Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office set him down in a chair and came back If somebodyll come here and sit with him he snapped authoritatively He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step his eyes avoiding the table As he passed close to me he whispered Lets get out Selfconsciously with his authoritative arms breaking the way we pushed through the still gathering crowd passing a hurried doctor case in hand who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bendthen his foot came down hard and the coup raced along through the night In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face The God damned coward he whimpered He didnt even stop his car  The Buchanans house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines Daisys home he said As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly I ought to have dropped you in West Egg Nick Theres nothing we can do tonight A change had come over him and he spoke gravely and with decision As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases Ill telephone for a taxi to take you home and while youre waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supperif you want any He opened the door Come in No thanks But Id be glad if youd order me the taxi Ill wait outside Jordan put her hand on my arm Wont you come in Nick No thanks I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone But Jordan lingered for a moment more Its only halfpast nine she said Id be damned if Id go in Id had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butlers voice calling a taxi Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate I hadnt gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon What are you doing I inquired Just standing here old sport Somehow that seemed a despicable occupation For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment I wouldnt have been surprised to see sinister faces the faces of Wolfshiems people behind him in the dark shrubbery Did you see any trouble on the road he asked after a minute Yes He hesitated Was she killed Yes I thought so I told Daisy I thought so Its better that the shock should all come at once She stood it pretty well He spoke as if Daisys reaction was the only thing that mattered I got to West Egg by a side road he went on and left the car in my garage I dont think anybody saw us but of course I cant be sure I disliked him so much by this time that I didnt find it necessary to tell him he was wrong Who was the woman he inquired Her name was Wilson Her husband owns the garage How the devil did it happen Well I tried to swing the wheel He broke off and suddenly I guessed at the truth Was Daisy driving Yes he said after a moment but of course Ill say I was You see when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to driveand this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us thought we were somebody she knew Well first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car and then she lost her nerve and turned back The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shockit must have killed her instantly It ripped her open Dont tell me old sport He winced AnyhowDaisy stepped on it I tried to make her stop but she couldnt so I pulled on the emergency brake Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on Shell be all right tomorrow he said presently Im just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon Shes locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality shes going to turn the light out and on again He wont touch her I said Hes not thinking about her I dont trust him old sport How long are you going to wait All night if necessary Anyhow till they all go to bed A new point of view occurred to me Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving He might think he saw a connection in ithe might think anything I looked at the house there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisys room on the ground floor You wait here I said Ill see if theres any sign of a commotion I walked back along the border of the lawn traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps The drawingroom curtains were open and I saw that the room was empty Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement They werent happy and neither of them had touched the chicken or the aleand yet they werent unhappy either There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive Is it all quiet up there he asked anxiously Yes its all quiet I hesitated Youd better come home and get some sleep He shook his head I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed Good night old sport He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlightwatching over nothing VIII I couldnt sleep all night a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound and I tossed halfsick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsbys drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dressI felt that I had something to tell him something to warn him about and morning would be too late Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall heavy with dejection or sleep Nothing happened he said wanly I waited and about four oclock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switchesonce I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadnt been aired for many days I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside Throwing open the French windows of the drawingroom we sat smoking out into the darkness You ought to go away I said Its pretty certain theyll trace your car Go away now old sport Go to Atlantic City for a week or up to Montreal He wouldnt consider it He couldnt possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do He was clutching at some last hope and I couldnt bear to shake him free It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Codytold it to me because Jay Gatsby had broken up like glass against Toms hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out I think that he would have acknowledged anything now without reserve but he wanted to talk about Daisy She was the first nice girl he had ever known In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between He found her excitingly desirable He went to her house at first with other officers from Camp Taylor then alone It amazed himhe had never been in such a beautiful house before But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived thereit was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him There was a ripe mystery about it a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this years shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisyit increased her value in his eyes He felt their presence all about the house pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions But he knew that he was in Daisys house by a colossal accident However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby he was at present a penniless young man without a past and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders So he made the most of his time He took what he could get ravenously and unscrupulouslyeventually he took Daisy one still October night took her because he had no real right to touch her hand He might have despised himself for he had certainly taken her under false pretences I dont mean that he had traded on his phantom millions but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herselfthat he was fully able to take care of her As a matter of fact he had no such facilitieshe had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world But he didnt despise himself and it didnt turn out as he had imagined He had intended probably to take what he could and gobut now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didnt realize just how extraordinary a nice girl could be She vanished into her rich house into her rich full life leaving Gatsbynothing He felt married to her that was all When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless who was somehow betrayed Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of starshine the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy gleaming like silver safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor  I cant describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her old sport I even hoped for a while that shed throw me over but she didnt because she was in love with me too She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her  Well there I was way off my ambitions getting deeper in love every minute and all of a sudden I didnt care What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long silent time It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coats shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers gently as though she were asleep  He did extraordinarily well in the war He was a captain before he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machineguns After the armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead He was worried nowthere was a quality of nervous despair in Daisys letters She didnt see why he couldnt come She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the Beale Street Blues while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an eveningdress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed And all the time something within her was crying for a decision She wanted her life shaped now immediatelyand the decision must be made by some forceof love of money of unquestionable practicalitythat was close at hand That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford  It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs filling the house with greyturning goldturning light The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves There was a slow pleasant movement in the air scarcely a wind promising a cool lovely day I dont think she ever loved him Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly You must remember old sport she was very excited this afternoon He told her those things in a way that frightened herthat made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying He sat down gloomily Of course she might have loved him just for a minute when they were first marriedand loved me more even then do you see Suddenly he came out with a curious remark In any case he said it was just personal What could you make of that except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldnt be measured He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay He stayed there a week walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the outoftheway places to which they had driven in her white car Just as Daisys house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself even though she was gone from it was pervaded with a melancholy beauty He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found herthat he was leaving her behind The daycoachhe was penniless nowwas hot He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a foldingchair and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by Then out into the spring fields where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which as it sank lower seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it the freshest and the best forever It was nine oclock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air The gardener the last one of Gatsbys former servants came to the foot of the steps Im going to drain the pool today Mr Gatsby Leavesll start falling pretty soon and then theres always trouble with the pipes Dont do it today Gatsby answered He turned to me apologetically You know old sport Ive never used that pool all summer I looked at my watch and stood up Twelve minutes to my train I didnt want to go to the city I wasnt worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than thatI didnt want to leave Gatsby I missed that train and then another before I could get myself away Ill call you up I said finally Do old sport Ill call you about noon We walked slowly down the steps I suppose Daisyll call too He looked at me anxiously as if he hoped Id corroborate this I suppose so Well goodbye We shook hands and I started away Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around Theyre a rotten crowd I shouted across the lawn Youre worth the whole damn bunch put together Ive always been glad I said that It was the only compliment I ever gave him because I disapproved of him from beginning to end First he nodded politely and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile as if wed been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruptionand he had stood on those steps concealing his incorruptible dream as he waved them goodbye I thanked him for his hospitality We were always thanking him for thatI and the others Goodbye I called I enjoyed breakfast Gatsby  Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock then I fell asleep in my swivelchair Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead It was Jordan Baker she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golflinks had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry Ive left Daisys house she said Im at Hempstead and Im going down to Southampton this afternoon Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisys house but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid You werent so nice to me last night How could it have mattered then Silence for a moment Then HoweverI want to see you I want to see you too Suppose I dont go to Southampton and come into town this afternoon NoI dont think this afternoon Very well Its impossible this afternoon Various We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we werent talking any longer I dont know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I didnt care I couldnt have talked to her across a teatable that day if I never talked to her again in this world I called Gatsbys house a few minutes later but the line was busy I tried four times finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit Taking out my timetable I drew a small circle around the threefifty train Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think It was just noon  When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car I supposed thered be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilsons tragic achievement was forgotten Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before They had difficulty in locating the sister Catherine She must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing When they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sisters body Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside For a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it Finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door Michaelis and several other men were with him first four or five men later two or three men Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn About three oclock the quality of Wilsons incoherent muttering changedhe grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen But when he heard himself say this he flinched and began to cry Oh my God again in his groaning voice Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him How long have you been married George Come on there try and sit still a minute and answer my question How long have you been married Twelve years Ever had any children Come on George sit stillI asked you a question Did you ever have any children The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadnt stopped a few hours before He didnt like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the officehe knew every object in it before morningand from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet Have you got a church you go to sometimes George Maybe even if you havent been there for a long time Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you see Dont belong to any You ought to have a church George for times like this You must have gone to church once Didnt you get married in a church Listen George listen to me Didnt you get married in a church That was a long time ago The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rockingfor a moment he was silent Then the same halfknowing halfbewildered look came back into his faded eyes Look in the drawer there he said pointing at the desk Which drawer That drawerthat one Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand There was nothing in it but a small expensive dogleash made of leather and braided silver It was apparently new This he inquired holding it up Wilson stared and nodded I found it yesterday afternoon She tried to tell me about it but I knew it was something funny You mean your wife bought it She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau Michaelis didnt see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dogleash But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before from Myrtle because he began saying Oh my God again in a whisperhis comforter left several explanations in the air Then he killed her said Wilson His mouth dropped open suddenly Who did I have a way of finding out Youre morbid George said his friend This has been a strain to you and you dont know what youre saying Youd better try and sit quiet till morning He murdered her It was an accident George Wilson shook his head His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior Hm I know he said definitely Im one of these trusting fellas and I dont think any harm to nobody but when I get to know a thing I know it It was the man in that car She ran out to speak to him and he wouldnt stop Michaelis had seen this too but it hadnt occurred to him that there was any special significance in it He believed that Mrs Wilson had been running away from her husband rather than trying to stop any particular car How could she of been like that Shes a deep one said Wilson as if that answered the question Ahhh He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for George This was a forlorn hopehe was almost sure that Wilson had no friend there was not enough of him for his wife He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room a blue quickening by the window and realized that dawn wasnt far off About five oclock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light Wilsons glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind I spoke to her he muttered after a long silence I told her she might fool me but she couldnt fool God I took her to the windowwith an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against itand I said God knows what youve been doing everything youve been doing You may fool me but you cant fool God  Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night God sees everything repeated Wilson Thats an advertisement Michaelis assured him Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room But Wilson stood there a long time his face close to the window pane nodding into the twilight  By six oclock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone His movementshe was on foot all the timewere afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gads Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didnt eat and a cup of coffee He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didnt reach Gads Hill until noon Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his timethere were boys who had seen a man acting sort of crazy and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road Then for three hours he disappeared from view The police on the strength of what he said to Michaelis that he had a way of finding out supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout inquiring for a yellow car On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward and perhaps he had an easier surer way of finding out what he wanted to know By halfpast two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsbys house So by that time he knew Gatsbys name  At two oclock Gatsby put on his bathingsuit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up Then he gave instructions that the open car wasnt to be taken out under any circumstancesand this was strange because the front right fender needed repair Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool Once he stopped and shifted it a little and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four oclockuntil long after there was anyone to give it to if it came I have an idea that Gatsby himself didnt believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world paid a high price for living too long with a single dream He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass A new world material without being real where poor ghosts breathing dreams like air drifted fortuitously about  like that ashen fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees The chauffeurhe was one of Wolfshiems protgsheard the shotsafterwards he could only say that he hadnt thought anything much about them I drove from the station directly to Gatsbys house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone But they knew then I firmly believe With scarcely a word said four of us the chauffeur butler gardener and I hurried down to the pool There was a faint barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly tracing like the leg of transit a thin red circle in the water It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilsons body a little way off in the grass and the holocaust was complete IX After two years I remember the rest of that day and that night and the next day only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsbys front door A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered openmouthed about the pool Someone with a positive manner perhaps a detective used the expression madman as he bent over Wilsons body that afternoon and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning Most of those reports were a nightmaregrotesque circumstantial eager and untrue When Michaeliss testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilsons suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinadebut Catherine who might have said anything didnt say a word She showed a surprising amount of character about it toolooked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby that her sister was completely happy with her husband that her sister had been into no mischief whatever She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure So Wilson was reduced to a man deranged by grief in order that the case might remain in its simplest form And it rested there But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential I found myself on Gatsbys side and alone From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village every surmise about him and every practical question was referred to me At first I was surprised and confused then as he lay in his house and didnt move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible because no one else was interestedinterested I mean with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him called her instinctively and without hesitation But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon and taken baggage with them Left no address No Say when theyd be back No Any idea where they are How I could reach them I dont know Cant say I wanted to get somebody for him I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him Ill get somebody for you Gatsby Dont worry Just trust me and Ill get somebody for you Meyer Wolfshiems name wasnt in the phone book The butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called Information but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone Will you ring again Ive rung three times Its very important Sorry Im afraid no ones there I went back to the drawingroom and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors all these official people who suddenly filled it But though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes his protest continued in my brain Look here old sport youve got to get somebody for me Youve got to try hard I cant go through this alone Someone started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his deskhed never told me definitely that his parents were dead But there was nothingonly the picture of Dan Cody a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it I was sure hed start when he saw the newspapers just as I was sure thered be a wire from Daisy before noonbut neither a wire nor Mr Wolfshiem arrived no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men When the butler brought back Wolfshiems answer I began to have a feeling of defiance of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all Dear Mr Carraway This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out Yours truly Meyer Wolfshiem and then hasty addenda beneath Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last But the connection came through as a mans voice very thin and far away This is Slagle speaking  Yes The name was unfamiliar Hell of a note isnt it Get my wire There havent been any wires Young Parkes in trouble he said rapidly They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter They got a circular from New York giving em the numbers just five minutes before What dyou know about that hey You never can tell in these hick towns Hello I interrupted breathlessly Look herethis isnt Mr Gatsby Mr Gatsbys dead There was a long silence on the other end of the wire followed by an exclamation  then a quick squawk as the connection was broken  I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came It was Gatsbys father a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat He was on the point of collapse so I took him into the musicroom and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat But he wouldnt eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand I saw it in the Chicago newspaper he said It was all in the Chicago newspaper I started right away I didnt know how to reach you His eyes seeing nothing moved ceaselessly about the room It was a madman he said He must have been mad Wouldnt you like some coffee I urged him I dont want anything Im all right now Mr Carraway Well Im all right now Where have they got Jimmy I took him into the drawingroom where his son lay and left him there Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall when I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away After a little while Mr Gatz opened the door and came out his mouth ajar his face flushed slightly his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride I helped him to a bedroom upstairs while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came I didnt know what youd want Mr Gatsby Gatz is my name Mr Gatz I thought you might want to take the body West He shook his head Jimmy always liked it better down East He rose up to his position in the East Were you a friend of my boys Mr We were close friends He had a big future before him you know He was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here He touched his head impressively and I nodded If hed of lived hed of been a great man A man like James J Hill Hed of helped build up the country Thats true I said uncomfortably He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet trying to take it from the bed and lay down stifflywas instantly asleep That night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name This is Mr Carraway I said Oh He sounded relieved This is Klipspringer I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsbys grave I didnt want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so Id been calling up a few people myself They were hard to find The funerals tomorrow I said Three oclock here at the house I wish youd tell anybody whod be interested Oh I will he broke out hastily Of course Im not likely to see anybody but if I do His tone made me suspicious Of course youll be there yourself Well Ill certainly try What I called up about is Wait a minute I interrupted How about saying youll come Well the fact isthe truth of the matter is that Im staying with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow In fact theres a sort of picnic or something Of course Ill do my best to get away I ejaculated an unrestrained Huh and he must have heard me for he went on nervously What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there I wonder if itd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on You see theyre tennis shoes and Im sort of helpless without them My address is care of B F I didnt hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsbyone gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved However that was my fault for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsbys liquor and I should have known better than to call him The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem I couldnt seem to reach him any other way The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked The Swastika Holding Company and at first there didnt seem to be anyone inside But when Id shouted hello several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes Nobodys in she said Mr Wolfshiems gone to Chicago The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle The Rosary tunelessly inside Please say that Mr Carraway wants to see him I cant get him back from Chicago can I At this moment a voice unmistakably Wolfshiems called Stella from the other side of the door Leave your name on the desk she said quickly Ill give it to him when he gets back But I know hes there She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips You young men think you can force your way in here any time she scolded Were getting sickantired of it When I say hes in Chicago hes in Chicago I mentioned Gatsby Ohh She looked at me over again Will you justWhat was your name She vanished In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway holding out both hands He drew me into his office remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us and offered me a cigar My memory goes back to when first I met him he said A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldnt buy some regular clothes First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenners poolroom at Fortythird Street and asked for a job He hadnt eat anything for a couple of days Come on have some lunch with me I said He ate more than four dollars worth of food in half an hour Did you start him in business I inquired Start him I made him Oh I raised him up out of nothing right out of the gutter I saw right away he was a fineappearing gentlemanly young man and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany We were so thick like that in everythinghe held up two bulbous fingersalways together I wondered if this partnership had included the Worlds Series transaction in  Now hes dead I said after a moment You were his closest friend so I know youll want to come to his funeral this afternoon Id like to come Well come then The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears I cant do itI cant get mixed up in it he said Theres nothing to get mixed up in Its all over now When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way I keep out When I was a young man it was differentif a friend of mine died no matter how I stuck with them to the end You may think thats sentimental but I mean itto the bitter end I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come so I stood up Are you a college man he inquired suddenly For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a gonnegtion but he only nodded and shook my hand Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead he suggested After that my own rule is to let everything alone When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall His pride in his son and in his sons possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me Jimmy sent me this picture He took out his wallet with trembling fingers Look there It was a photograph of the house cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands He pointed out every detail to me eagerly Look there and then sought admiration from my eyes He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself Jimmy sent it to me I think its a very pretty picture It shows up well Very well Had you seen him lately He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now there was a reason for it He knew he had a big future in front of him And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me He seemed reluctant to put away the picture held it for another minute lingeringly before my eyes Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy Look here this is a book he had when he was a boy It just shows you He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see On the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule and the date September   And underneath Rise from bed  am Dumbell exercise and wallscaling   Study electricity etc   Work  pm Baseball and sports   Practise elocution poise and how to attain it   Study needed inventions   General Resolves  No wasting time at Shafters or a name indecipherable  No more smokeing or chewing  Bath every other day  Read one improving book or magazine per week  Save  crossed out  per week  Be better to parents I came across this book by accident said the old man It just shows you dont it It just shows you Jimmy was bound to get ahead He always had some resolves like this or something Do you notice what hes got about improving his mind He was always great for that He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it He was reluctant to close the book reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars So did Gatsbys father And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way The minister glanced several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour But it wasnt any use Nobody came  About five oclock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gatefirst a motor hearse horribly black and wet then Mr Gatz and the minister and me in the limousine and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsbys station wagon all wet to the skin As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground I looked around It was the man with owleyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsbys books in the library one night three months before Id never seen him since then I dont know how he knew about the funeral or even his name The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsbys grave I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember without resentment that Daisy hadnt sent a message or a flower Dimly I heard someone murmur Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on and then the owleyed man said Amen to that in a brave voice We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars Owleyes spoke to me by the gate I couldnt get to the house he remarked Neither could anybody else Go on He started Why my God they used to go there by the hundreds He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in The poor sonofabitch he said  One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six oclock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gaieties to bid them a hasty goodbye I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss ThisorThats and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations Are you going to the Ordways the Herseys the Schultzes and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago Milwaukee and St Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow our snow began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again Thats my Middle Westnot the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow I am part of that a little solemn with the feel of those long winters a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a familys name I see now that this has been a story of the West after allTom and Gatsby Daisy and Jordan and I were all Westerners and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life Even when the East excited me most even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored sprawling swollen towns beyond the Ohio with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very oldeven then it had always for me a quality of distortion West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams I see it as a night scene by El Greco a hundred houses at once conventional and grotesque crouching under a sullen overhanging sky and a lustreless moon In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress Her hand which dangles over the side sparkles cold with jewels Gravely the men turn in at a housethe wrong house But no one knows the womans name and no one cares After Gatsbys death the East was haunted for me like that distorted beyond my eyes power of correction So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home There was one thing to be done before I left an awkward unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration her chin raised a little jauntily her hair the colour of an autumn leaf her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised For just a minute I wondered if I wasnt making a mistake then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye Nevertheless you did throw me over said Jordan suddenly You threw me over on the telephone I dont give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while We shook hands Oh and do you remembershe addeda conversation we had once about driving a car Whynot exactly You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver Well I met another bad driver didnt I I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess I thought you were rather an honest straightforward person I thought it was your secret pride Im thirty I said Im five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour She didnt answer Angry and half in love with her and tremendously sorry I turned away  One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert aggressive way his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference his head moving sharply here and there adapting itself to his restless eyes Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand Whats the matter Nick Do you object to shaking hands with me Yes You know what I think of you Youre crazy Nick he said quickly Crazy as hell I dont know whats the matter with you Tom I inquired what did you say to Wilson that afternoon He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm I told him the truth he said He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we werent in he tried to force his way upstairs He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadnt told him who owned the car His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house He broke off defiantly What if I did tell him That fellow had it coming to him He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisys but he was a tough one He ran over Myrtle like youd run over a dog and never even stopped his car There was nothing I could say except the one unutterable fact that it wasnt true And if you think I didnt have my share of sufferinglook here when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby By God it was awful I couldnt forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was to him entirely justified It was all very careless and confused They were careless people Tom and Daisythey smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made  I shook hands with him it seemed silly not to for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklaceor perhaps only a pair of cuff buttonsrid of my provincial squeamishness forever  Gatsbys house was still empty when I leftthe grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own I didnt want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps But I didnt investigate Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didnt know that the party was over On the last night with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more On the white steps an obscene word scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors eyesa fresh green breast of the new world Its vanished trees the trees that had made way for Gatsbys house had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder And as I sat there brooding on the old unknown world I thought of Gatsbys wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisys dock He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it He did not know that it was already behind him somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night Gatsby believed in the green light the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us It eluded us then but thats no mattertomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms further  And one fine morning So we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past  END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG
